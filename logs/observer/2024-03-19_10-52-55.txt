INFO from Alice: Understood. To ensure we both reach our destinations without collision, one of us should use either A3 or C4 to make room for the other. Let's assume that you will take the detour since I am on the top and it will be more efficient for you to move into A3 as you approach from below. Let's plan our movements accordingly:

Your plan to reach B7:
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (into A3 and wait)
4. @WAIT (while I pass B3)
5. @FORWARD (B3)
6. @FORWARD (B4)
7. @FORWARD (B5)
8. @FORWARD (B6)
9. @FORWARD (B7)

My plan to reach B0:
1. @FORWARD (B6)
2. @FORWARD (B5)
3. @FORWARD (B4)
4. @FORWARD (B3 - while you wait in A3)
5. @FORWARD (B2)
6. @FORWARD (B1)
7. @FORWARD (B0)

By following this synchronized plan, you can make room for me to pass through B3 while you temporarily wait in A3. Once I've cleared that area, you can continue north to reach B7 while I make my way south to B0. With this plan, we will not collide, and our objectives will be efficiently met.

@SUPERVISOR
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Alice: Supervisor called
INFO from Bob: Your plan is clear. Here is the updated concise version of the plans that we'll both follow, where I will move aside into A3 while you pass:

Your Plan to reach B7:
1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @WAIT
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD

My Plan to reach B0:
1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD

Once I've reached A3 and waited for you to pass B3, we can both continue our paths to our destinations. This plan prevents any collisions and achieves our goal efficiently.

@SUPERVISOR
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Bob: Supervisor called
INFO from Alice: Your plan to reach B7:
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @ANTICLOCKWISE (face West)
4. @FORWARD (into A3 and wait)
5. @WAIT (while I pass B3)
6. @CLOCKWISE (face North)
7. @FORWARD (B3)
8. @FORWARD (B4)
9. @FORWARD (B5)
10. @FORWARD (B6)
11. @FORWARD (B7)

My plan to reach B0:
1. @FORWARD (B6)
2. @FORWARD (B5)
3. @FORWARD (B4)
4. @FORWARD (B3 - while you wait in A3)
5. @FORWARD (B2)
6. @FORWARD (B1)
7. @FORWARD (B0)

Both our plans are designed to avoid any collision, letting you detour into A3 as I pass through B3, after which you proceed north to B7 and I continue south to B0.

Given the updated scenario where you are currently at B2 facing West and I am at B4 facing East, and considering that we still need to swap positions without colliding, the following plan should work: 

You will move into A3 to allow me to pass. Once I am past B3, headed towards B0, you can continue your path towards B7. Your summarized plan is as follows:

Your Plan to reach B7:
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face South)

1. @FORWARD (move from C4 to B4)
2. @FORWARD (move from B4 to B5)
3. @FORWARD (move from B5 to B6)
4. @FORWARD (move from B6 to B7)
INFO from Alice: Final plan for 192.168.193.58
Since you are currently at B0 facing West and need to get to B7, and I am at C4 facing East and need to get to B0, we need a plan that allows us to pass each other without collision. Here is your plan:

Based on the current scenario where you are at B0 facing West and need to end at B7, and I am at C4 facing East and need to end at B0, without renegotiating and focusing solely on your moves, your steps to reach B7 would be:

1. @CLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD

This plan allows you to turn around and head North up the B column, reaching B7 without interference as I am positioned in C4 out of your direct path.
INFO from Alice: Final plan for 192.168.193.58
To resolve the current situation, let's ignore the previous plans and create a new plan from our current positions. Since you are at B0 facing West, and I am at C4 facing North, your goal is to reach B7, and my goal is to reach B0, here is the new plan for your movements:

1. @CLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD

With this plan, you will turn to face North, then proceed straightforward to B7. I will remain in C4 until you pass B3, ensuring we do not collide. After you proceed beyond B3, I will move towards B0. Please wait for confirmation that I am at B0 before making your move from B3 to B4.

1. @CLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD

Complete these steps in order to arrive at B7 without any collisions, as I will be waiting at C4 and will not interfere with your path.
INFO from Bob: Final plan for 192.168.193.203
Understood, let's reassess our positions and determine a new plan. Currently, you are at C4, and I'm at B0. You need to reach B0, and I need to reach B7. You are facing North, and I'm facing West. 

In this scenario, it's efficient for you to first move out of the way to allow me to pass through the corridor safely. Since you're closer to C4, you can temporarily move into C4 while I progress northwards. Once I am out of the corridor and no longer at risk of collision, you can proceed to B0.

Here's your new plan:

1. @FORWARD (from C4 into C3)
2. @ANTICLOCKWISE (turn to face West)
3. @FORWARD (from C3 into B3)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE (turn to face South)
5. @FORWARD (to B2)
6. @FORWARD (to B1)
7. @FORWARD (to B0)

Please confirm if this plan is acceptable for you. Once we agree, we will both execute our movements simultaneously to avoid collision.
INFO from Alice: Final plan for 192.168.193.58
Since you are currently at B0 facing West and I am at C4 facing East, and you need to end at B7 while I need to end at B0, the following plan will allow us to pass each other safely:

Your Plan to reach B7:

1. @CLOCKWISE (to face North)
2. @FORWARD (to B1)
3. @FORWARD (to B2)
4. @FORWARD (to B3)
5. @FORWARD (to B4)
6. @FORWARD (to B5)
7. @FORWARD (to B6)
8. @FORWARD (to reach B7)

Since I'm already in C4, you can proceed north without any need to wait, as there is no risk of collision. This plan will take you straight to B7.

Let's create a new plan from our current positions to resolve the situation.

Your updated plan to move from B0 to B7 with you facing West and me at C4 facing North is as follows:

1. @CLOCKWISE (to face North)
2. @FORWARD (to B1)
3. @FORWARD (to B2)
4. @FORWARD (to B3)
5. @FORWARD (to B4)
6. @FORWARD (to B5)

Since I am at C4 and out of the way, you will be able to move north up column B without any obstructions. Please proceed with this plan to reach B7.
