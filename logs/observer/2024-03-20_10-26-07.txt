INFO from Alice: Certainly! To minimize the number of moves and ensure that we do not collide while both reaching our destinations, one of us should move into the side grid (A3 or C4) while the other passes through. As I am at the top of the corridor B7 and you are at the bottom B0, and since you need to end at B7 and I need to end at B0, here's a plan where I will move aside to let you pass:

I will move into A3, wait for you to pass, and then continue my path to B0. Meanwhile, you will move straight up to B7. Here's the step-by-step plan:

Your plan:
1. @FORWARD (to B1)
2. @FORWARD (to B2)
3. @FORWARD (to B3)
4. @FORWARD (to B4)
5. @FORWARD (to B5)
6. @FORWARD (to B6)
7. @FORWARD (to B7)

My plan:
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face East)
2. @FORWARD (to C4)
3. @CLOCKWISE (to face South)
4. @WAIT
5. @WAIT
6. @WAIT
7. @WAIT
8. @WAIT
9. @WAIT
10. @WAIT
11. @FORWARD (to B7)
12. @FORWARD (to B6)
13. @FORWARD (to B5)
14. @FORWARD (to B4)
15. @FORWARD (to B3)
16. @FORWARD (to B2)
17. @FORWARD (to B1)
18. @FORWARD (to B0)

This way, while you are moving forward towards B7, I will move out of the way into C4 and wait until you've reached B7. After you've arrived, I will begin moving
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: I've noticed a mistake in my plan, as I indicated that I should turn anticlockwise and move to C4, but the diagram shows that the space to the East of B4 is C4, which means I need to turn clockwise to face East. Let's correct the plan accordingly:

Your plan:
1. @FORWARD (to B1)
2. @FORWARD (to B2)
3. @FORWARD (to B3)
4. @FORWARD (to B4)
5. @FORWARD (to B5)
6. @FORWARD (to B6)
7. @FORWARD (to B7)

My corrected plan:
1. @CLOCKWISE (to face East)
2. @FORWARD (to C4)
3. @CLOCKWISE (to face South)
4. @WAIT (until you reach B4)
5. @WAIT (until you reach B5)
6. @WAIT (until you reach B6)
7. @WAIT (until you reach B7)
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face North)
9. @FORWARD (to B7)
10. @FORWARD (to B6)
11. @FORWARD (to B5)
12. @FORWARD (to B4)
13. @FORWARD (to B3)
14. @FORWARD (to B2)
15. @FORWARD (to B1)
16. @FORWARD (to B0)

This corrected plan ensures that I turn in the correct direction to move into C4 and wait for you to pass before continuing to B0. Since both of our plans are synchronized and agreed upon, we can execute them simultaneously without any collisions.

INFO from Alice: Apologies, there seems to be a mistake in the number of @WAIT commands. I should wait for you to pass by B4, B5, B6, and arrive at B7, which amounts to four wait cycles while I am in C4 rather than seven. Here's the corrected plan:

Your plan:
1. @FORWARD (to B1)
2. @FORWARD (to B2)
3. @FORWARD (to B3)
4. @FORWARD (to B4)
5. @FORWARD (to B5)
6. @FORWARD (to B6)
7. @FORWARD (to B7)

My corrected plan:
1. @CLOCKWISE (to face East)
2. @FORWARD (to C4)
3. @CLOCKWISE (to face South)
4. @WAIT (until you reach B4)
5. @WAIT (until you reach B5)
6. @WAIT (until you reach B6)
7. @WAIT (until you reach B7)
8. @CLOCKWISE (to face West)
9. @FORWARD (to B7)
10. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face South)
11. @FORWARD (to B6)
12. @FORWARD (to B5)
13. @FORWARD (to B4)
14. @FORWARD (to B3)
15. @FORWARD (to B2)
16. @FORWARD (to B1)
17. @FORWARD (to B0)

Now that we have a plan that includes the correct number of wait cycles and proper turns, we can proceed.

Based on the current positions (I am at B1 facing South and you are at B6 facing North), and considering that we need to reach B0 and B7 respectively without collision, here is your updated plan:

Your plan to move from B6 to B7:
1. @FORWARD (to B7)

This plan allows you to reach your destination without any further need for negotiation, as you only have one move to make to reach B7.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. To create a new plan based on our current positions with you at B6 facing North and me at B1 facing South, we will generate a new plan. The goal is to have you finish at B7 and me at B0 without any collision.

For me to reach B0 and for you to reach B7 without any collision, I will move into C4 while you proceed to B7. Once you are there, I will move back to the corridor and go to B0. Here is the new plan detailing only the moves you should take:

1. @FORWARD (from B6 to B7)
