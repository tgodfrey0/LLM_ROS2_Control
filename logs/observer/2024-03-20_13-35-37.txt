INFO from Alice: To execute this plan efficiently, it's essential to determine who will move into the holding areas (A3 or C4) to allow the other agent to pass. Since I am at B7 and you are at B0, and we are both facing each other with our goals behind the other agent, I propose the following plan to minimize the number of moves:

1. I will move into the holding area C4 to allow you to pass.
2. You will move straight towards your goal at B7.
3. Once you pass the holding area C4, I will continue moving towards my goal at B0.

Here's the specific movement plan:

Your Movement Plan:
1. @FORWARD - progress towards the goal
2. @FORWARD - continue moving North
3. @FORWARD - approach the intersection
4. @FORWARD - pass by where I have moved aside
5. @FORWARD - move closer to the goal
6. @FORWARD - almost reach the goal at B7
7. @FORWARD - arrive at B7

My Movement Plan:
1. @CLOCKWISE - to turn East towards C4
2. @FORWARD - enter C4
3. @ANTICLOCKWISE - face South to prepare to continue once you've passed
4. @WAIT - allow you to pass by C4
5. @WAIT - continue waiting, ensure space to pass
6. @WAIT - make sure you have passed
7. @WAIT - ensure you've reached the goal before moving
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE - to face West towards B4
9. @FORWARD - move to B4
10. @ANTICLOCKWISE - face South towards B0
11. @FORWARD - move closer to B0
12. @FORWARD - move to B2
13. @FORWARD - approach the goal at B0
14. @FORWARD - arrive at
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: It seems there might be a misunderstanding in your plan. If I move into C4, then you would have to wait until I clear the B4-B7 passage for you to move all the way to B7. We should adjust the plan for efficiency, ensuring that the passage is clear when you reach it. 

Let's refine the plan, ensuring that I move into C4, wait for you to pass, and then proceed to B0:

Your Movement Plan:
1. @FORWARD - Move from B0 to B1.
2. @FORWARD - Move from B1 to B2.
3. @FORWARD - Move from B2 to B3.
4. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to B4.
5. @FORWARD - By now, I should have cleared C4.
6. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to B5.
7. @FORWARD - Move from B5 to B6.
8. @FORWARD - Arrive at B7.

My Movement Plan:
1. @CLOCKWISE - Turn to face East.
2. @FORWARD - Enter C4 from B4.
3. @WAIT - Wait for you to pass B4.
4. @WAIT - Continue waiting to ensure you've passed.
5. @WAIT - Ensure you're clear of B4.
6. @WAIT - Confirm you're on your way to B5.
7. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face North.
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face West, back down the corridor.
9. @FORWARD - Exit C4 to B4 after you've passed.
10. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to B3.
11. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to B2.
12. @FORWARD - Move from B2 to B1.
13. @FORWARD - Arrive at B0.

This should ensure that we both reach our
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Alice: destinations without any collisions. Here's the revised plan, laid out more concisely:

Your Movement Plan (from B0 to B7):
1. @FORWARD - Move towards the goal.
2. @FORWARD - Continue advancing.
3. @FORWARD - Keep moving up the corridor.
4. @FORWARD - Proceed forward.
5. @FORWARD - Approaching the intersection with C4.
6. @FORWARD - Move past the intersection.
7. @FORWARD - Nearing the end goal.
8. @FORWARD - Arrive at B7.

My Movement Plan (from B7 to B0):
1. @CLOCKWISE - Turn East towards C4.
2. @FORWARD - Move into holding area C4.
3. @WAIT - Allow you to pass B4.
4. @WAIT - Continue to wait.
5. @WAIT - Make sure you are clear of B4.
6. @WAIT - Confirm you are moving towards B5.
7. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face North.
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face West towards the corridor.
9. @FORWARD - Move out of C4 to B4.
10. @FORWARD - Proceed to B3.
11. @FORWARD - Continue to B2.
12. @FORWARD - Move to B1.

Since we need to bypass each other and can't occupy the same space on the grid at the same time, I will outline a plan using the holding areas A3 and C4. To ensure we follow the instructions correctly, I'll head into C4 while you make your way north up the corridor toward B7. Once you've passed C4, I'll head back out and continue to B0.

Bob's Movement Plan from B7 to B0:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - to face South from B7.
2. @FORWARD - to move from B7 to B6.
3. @FORWARD - to move from B6 to B5.
4. @FORWARD - to move from B5 to B4.
5. @ANTICLOCKWISE - to turn East toward C4.
6. @FORWARD - to enter C4.
7. @WAIT - wait for you to pass by C4 to B5.
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE - to turn North, back towards the corridor.
9. @FORWARD - to exit C4 to B4.
10. @ANTICLOCKWISE - to turn West towards B3.
11. @FORWARD - to move from B4 to B3.
12. @FORWARD - to move from B3 to B2.
13. @FORWARD - to move from B2 to B1.

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Rotate to face South.
2. @FORWARD - Move to B6.
3. @FORWARD - Move to B5.
4. @FORWARD - Move to B4.
5. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Rotate to face East towards C4.

Since the situation requires a new plan because both agents are facing their respective destinations but also facing each other, and assuming it has been decided that Bob will move into a holding area to let the other agent pass, here's the list for Bob:

Assuming Bob starts at B7 and needs to end at B0:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - to face South.
2. @FORWARD - to move from B7 to B6.
3. @FORWARD - to move from B6 to B5.

13. @ANTICLOCKWISE - to face West towards destination.
14. @FORWARD - to move from B4 to B3.

Since there's been a misunderstanding regarding the starting orientation and I made an error in the last response, let's correct that. Given you are at B0 facing your goal at B7 and I'm at B7 facing my goal at B0, and we are both currently facing West, the plan for me, Alice, to reach B0 is as follows:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn South to avoid a head-on path.
2. @FORWARD - Move to B6 to make room for you to move forward.
3. @FORWARD - Move to B5.
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn Eastward to prepare to enter holding area A3.
5. @FORWARD - Move to A5, adjacent to the holding area.
6. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn North into holding area A3.
