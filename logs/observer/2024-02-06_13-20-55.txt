INFO from Alice: Given the situation, here's a plan that ensures we both reach our desired destinations without collision, taking into consideration our starting points and orientations:

1. @FORWARD (We both move one square forward; I move to B1, you move to B6.)
2. @FORWARD (I move to B2, you move to B5.)
3. @FORWARD (I move to B3, you move to B4.)
4. @WAIT (I wait at B3; you wait at B4.)
5. @ANTICLOCKWISE (I rotate 90 degrees anticlockwise to face West; you rotate 90 degrees anticlockwise to face East.)
6. @ANTICLOCKWISE (I rotate again to face South; you rotate again to face North.)
7. @FORWARD (Now facing each other, we swap places; I move into B4, you move into B3.)
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE (I rotate 90 degrees anticlockwise to face East; you rotate 90 degrees anticlockwise to face West.)
9. @ANTICLOCKWISE (I rotate again to face North; you rotate again to face South.)
10. @FORWARD (I move to B3, you move to B4.)
11. @FORWARD (I move to B2, you move to B5.)
12. @FORWARD (I move to B1, you move to B6.)
13. @FORWARD (I reach B7, you reach B0.)

This strategy ensures no collisions occur as we effectively switch places on B3 and B4 with a series of moves and rotations, finally allowing each of us to reach the opposite end of the corridor.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: I see a misunderstanding in your plan at step 7. Based on the provided instructions and our initial orientation, we can't swap places directly by moving forward after rotating to face each other because we would collide. We must adjust the plan to avoid any collisions and ensure we both reach our respective destinations safely and efficiently.

Here's a revised plan that addresses the potential collision and adheres to the command constraints:

1. @FORWARD (We both advance one square towards each other.)
2. @FORWARD (Continuing to move towards the center.)
3. @FORWARD (Approaching the point where we might cross paths.)
4. @WAIT (Standing still to evaluate our next move.)
5. @CLOCKWISE (I rotate 90 degrees clockwise to face east; you do the same to face west.)
6. @FORWARD (We both move one square in our new direction, parallel to each other, avoiding a direct confrontation.)
7. @FORWARD (Advancing further, maintaining the parallel path.)
8. @CLOCKWISE (Rotating 90 degrees clockwise again to realign with our original direction towards each other.)
9. @CLOCKWISE (Rotating another 90 degrees clockwise to ensure we are facing the correct direction for the final approach.)
10. @FORWARD (We move forward, now on parallel tracks that do not intersect.)
11. @FORWARD (Continuing forward.)
12. @CLOCKWISE (Rotating 90 degrees clockwise to face our destination direction.)
13. @CLOCKWISE (An additional 90-degree clockwise rotation to ensure we're facing the correct way.)
14. @FORWARD (Moving towards our final destinations.)
15. @FORWARD (Reaching our respective ends of the corridor safely.)

This plan involves using the grid's space more efficiently for parallel movement and avoids any potential collision by ensuring we never attempt to occupy the same square at the same time.

Let's agree on this updated approach to ensure a safe
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Alice: I understand the concern raised and I agree with your assessment regarding the need to avoid a collision. From our starting points and given directions, moving directly towards each other initially and then maneuvering to prevent a direct collision makes sense. However, there seems to be a slight oversight in the rotation logic that might not lead us to swap positions effectively in the corridor while adhering to the constraints provided.

Considering we need to ensure we do not move into the same square and rotate correctly to end up at each other's starting positions, here’s a rectified and simplified plan for us to follow:

1. @FORWARD (We both move one square towards the center; I to B1, you to B6.)
2. @FORWARD (Continuing towards the center; I to B2, you to B5.)
3. @FORWARD (Approaching closest points without colliding; I to B3, you to B4.)
4. @CLOCKWISE (I rotate 90 degrees clockwise to face east; you also rotate clockwise to face west.)
5. @FORWARD (We both move one square to the side; I move eastward away from the center line, you move westward away from the center line.)
6. @CLOCKWISE (We both rotate 90 degrees clockwise; I now face south, you face north.)
7. @FORWARD (Moving back towards our originally intended paths but on parallel tracks; I move to where you were, you move to where I was.)
8. @CLOCKWISE (Rotating 90 degrees clockwise to realign with our endpoint orientations; I’m aiming for north, you for south.)
9. @FORWARD (We both move one square back towards the center line; on our swapped parallel tracks.)
10. @CLOCKWISE x2 (Both of us rotate 180 degrees to face towards our respective destinations; ensuring I am facing north and you are facing south.)
11. @FORWARD (Heading towards
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 4
INFO from Bob: the destinations on our new parallel paths; I move forward to the square closer to your original starting point, and you do the same towards mine.)
12. @FORWARD (Continuing forward; closing the distance to our end goals.)
13. @FORWARD (Moving one step closer to the end of the corridor.)
14. @FORWARD (We reach our destinations; I arrive at your original starting position, and you arrive at mine.)

This plan ensures we both navigate the corridor safely, adhering strictly to the initial constraints and effectively avoiding any collision by making strategic use of rotations and parallel movements.

INFO from Bob: I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have a real-time execution or interactive supervision capability, so I can't process or execute live commands such as the "@SUPERVISOR" tag in a real-time environment or simulation. My role here is to assist and generate responses based on the input provided. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 7
INFO from Alice: It seems I misunderstood the task in my response. My last message doesn't align with the guidelines provided for how I should respond in this scenario, particularly about negotiating and finalizing a plan for movement without directly invoking the supervisor tag inappropriately. Let's ensure we've reached an agreement on the final plan:

1. @FORWARD (We both move one square towards the center.)
2. @FORWARD (Continuing towards the center.)
3. @FORWARD (I move to B3, you move to B4, close but without colliding.)
4. @CLOCKWISE (I rotate 90 degrees to face east; you rotate 90 degrees to face west.)
5. @FORWARD (Moving to parallel paths; I move eastward from the center line, you move westward.)
6. @CLOCKWISE (We both rotate 90 degrees to now face back toward our goal directions but on parallel paths.)
7. @FORWARD (We shift back towards the center line on our new parallel paths.)
8. @CLOCKWISE (Rotating again to face toward our final destinations.)
9. @FORWARD (Starting our final approach, now aligned with our destinations but on parallel paths.)
10. @FORWARD (Continuing our approach.)
11. @FORWARD (Moving closer.)
12. @FORWARD (Nearing our destinations.)
13. @FORWARD (Reaching the end points; I am now at B7, you are at B0.)

This revised plan takes into account the correction and ensures no collision by making strategic use of our moves and rotations, effectively swapping our positions. 

Do we agree on this being our final plan?
