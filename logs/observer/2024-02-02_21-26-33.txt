INFO from Alice: To ensure we do not collide while swapping positions, we'll need to strategize a path. We can pass each other by utilizing the additional columns. I propose the following plan to ensure a safe switch of our positions:

1. We both move @FORWARD to B6 and B1 respectively.
2. I rotate @CLOCKWISE to face right, and you rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face left.
3. We move @FORWARD into C6 and A1 respectively.
4. I rotate @CLOCKWISE to face down, and you rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face up.
5. We both move @FORWARD to C1 and A6 respectively.
6. I rotate @CLOCKWISE to face left, and you rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face right.
7. We both move @FORWARD into B1 and B6 respectively.
8. I rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face up, and you rotate @CLOCKWISE to face down.
9. We both move @FORWARD to reach our final destinations at B0 and B7 respectively.

@SUPERVISOR, here is the final plan:

1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @CLOCKWISE / @ANTICLOCKWISE
4. @FORWARD
5. @CLOCKWISE / @ANTICLOCKWISE
6. @FORWARD
7. @CLOCKWISE / @ANTICLOCKWISE
8. @FORWARD
9. @ANTICLOCKWISE / @CLOCKWISE
10. @FORWARD
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: Your plan is well-thought-out, but we need to correct the fact that we should be moving simultaneously and with the correct sequence of turns and moves. Let's go through the steps one by one:

1. We both move @FORWARD to B6 and B1 respectively.
2. I rotate @CLOCKWISE to face right towards column C, and you rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face left towards column A.
3. We both move @FORWARD into C6 and A1 respectively.
4. I rotate @CLOCKWISE to face down towards B5, and you rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face up towards B2.
5. We both move @FORWARD to C5 and A2 respectively.
6. I rotate @CLOCKWISE to face left towards B, and you rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face right towards B.
7. We both move @FORWARD into B5 and B2 respectively.
8. We both move @FORWARD to B4 and B3 respectively, passing each other.
9. We continue moving @FORWARD to B3 and B4 respectively.
10. I rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face upwards towards B0, and you rotate @CLOCKWISE to face downwards towards B7.
11. We both move @FORWARD to B2 and B5 respectively.
12. We continue moving @FORWARD to B1 and B6 respectively.
13. I rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face B0, and you rotate @CLOCKWISE to face B7.
14. Finally, we both move @FORWARD to reach our final destinations at B0 and B7 respectively.

@SUPERVISOR, here is the corrected final plan:

1. @FORWARD
2. @CLOCKWISE / @ANTICLOCKWISE
3. @FORWARD
4. @CLOCKWISE / @ANTICLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD
6. @CLOCKWISE / @ANTICLOCKWISE
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @ANTICLOCKWISE / @CLOCKWISE
11. @FORWARD
12. @FORWARD
13. @ANTICLOCKWISE / @CLOCKWISE
14. @FORWARD
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Alice: Your sequence is almost correct, but let's ensure the plan is perfectly synchronized so that we move at the same time during each step. Hereâ€™s the revised plan:

1. We both move @FORWARD to B6 and B1, respectively.
2. I rotate @CLOCKWISE to face right towards column C, and you rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face left towards column A.
3. We both move @FORWARD into C6 and A1, respectively.
4. I rotate @CLOCKWISE to face down towards B5, and you rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face up towards B2.
5. We both move @FORWARD to C5 and A2, respectively.
6. I rotate @CLOCKWISE to face left towards B, and you rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face right towards B.
7. We both move @FORWARD into B5 and B2, respectively.
8. We both move @FORWARD again to B4 and B3, respectively, passing each other in adjacent columns.
9. We both move @FORWARD to B3 and B4, respectively.
10. I rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face up towards B7, and you rotate @CLOCKWISE to face down towards B0.
11. We both move @FORWARD to B2 and B5, respectively.
12. We both move @FORWARD again to B1 and B6, respectively.
13. I rotate @ANTICLOCKWISE to face up towards B7, and you rotate @CLOCKWISE to face down towards B0.
14. We both move @FORWARD to reach our final destinations at B0 and B7, respectively.

Now, calling the @SUPERVISOR, here is the final synchronized plan:

1. @FORWARD
2. @CLOCKWISE / @ANTICLOCKWISE
3. @FORWARD
4. @CLOCKWISE / @ANTICLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD
6. @CLOCKWISE / @ANTICLOCKWISE
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @ANTICLOCKWISE / @CLOCKWISE
11. @FORWARD
12. @FORWARD
13. @ANTICLOCKWISE / @CLOCKWISE
14. @FORWARD
