INFO from Alice: Understood. Since I am at B7 and facing South, and you are at B0 facing North, the most efficient way to allow both of us to reach our destinations without collision is for one of us to use the waiting area (A3 or C4) while the other passes by. I propose I move into the waiting area A3, as it is on my immediate left, which allows you to pass by without delay. Once you've passed, I can proceed to B0.

Here is the plan:

Your moves:
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3) - I will be waiting at A3 at this point
4. @FORWARD (B4)
5. @FORWARD (B5)
6. @FORWARD (B6)
7. @FORWARD (B7)

My moves:
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face East)
2. @FORWARD (A7)
3. @FORWARD (A6)
4. @FORWARD (A5)
5. @FORWARD (A4)
6. @FORWARD (A3) - I will wait here until you pass
7. @WAIT 
8. @WAIT 
9. @WAIT 
10. @WAIT 
11. @WAIT 
12. @WAIT
13. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face South)
14. @BACKWARDS (B3)
15. @FORWARD (B2)
16. @FORWARD (B1)
17. @FORWARD (B0)

We will both start executing our plans at the same time. When you reach B3, I will already be in A3 waiting. You will then proceed to B7 without delay, and once you've passed B3, I will exit A3 and head to B0.

@SUPERVISOR, can you confirm this plan and oversee its execution
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Alice: Supervisor called
INFO from Alice: Apologies for the oversight. Let me revise my plan to eliminate the confusion in the movements. I initially suggested moving back into B3 from A3, which is not allowed as per the rules. Here is the corrected plan:

Your moves:
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3) - I will be waiting at A3 at this point
4. @FORWARD (B4)
5. @FORWARD (B5)
6. @FORWARD (B6)
7. @FORWARD (B7)

My moves:
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face East)
2. @FORWARD (A7)
3. @FORWARD (A6)
4. @FORWARD (A5)
5. @FORWARD (A4)
6. @FORWARD (A3) - I will wait here until you pass
7. @WAIT 
8. @WAIT 
9. @WAIT 
10. @WAIT 
11. @WAIT 
12. @WAIT
13. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face West)
14. @FORWARD (B3)
15. @FORWARD (B2)
16. @FORWARD (B1)
17. @FORWARD (B0)

Once in A3, I will wait for you to move past B3, then rotate and continue to B0. This will prevent any collision, and both of us will reach our destinations.

@SUPERVISOR, please confirm if this revised plan is acceptable and supervise its execution.

INFO from Bob: The plan seems well-structured, with you using the A3 waiting area to allow me to pass through. However, after closely reviewing the plan, there seems to be a small issue with the commands. On my side, there should not be a '@BACKWARDS' command since I'll be facing south after moving into A3 and will just need to move forwards to B3 after turning anticlockwise to face west.

Here's the corrected plan:

Your moves:
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3) - I will be waiting at A3 at this point

Certainly, if you are at B7 facing West and I'm at B0 facing South, as per the instructions to end at B0 and B7 respectively, here's a new summarized plan for Bob to execute:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE
9. @FORWARD (This move takes Bob into A3, the waiting area)
10. @WAIT (Bob waits here until it's clear to move)
11. @WAIT (Continue waiting)
12. @WAIT (Continue waiting)
13. @WAIT (Continue waiting)
14. @WAIT (Continue waiting)
15. @WAIT (Continue waiting)
16. @CLOCKWISE (Bob is now facing South)
17. @FORWARD (Bob moves from A3 to B3)
18. @FORWARD (Bob moves to B2)
19. @FORWARD (Bob moves to B1)
20. @FORWARD (Bob reaches B0)

Bob will wait in A3 until the other agent has passed B3 on their way to B7. After that, Bob can continue safely to B0.

Please proceed with the execution of these moves.

Given the current situation with me at B7 facing West and you at B0 facing West, let's develop a new plan. I will head to A3 to wait while you pass through B3, after which I can continue to B0. Here's the summarised plan for my movements:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @ANTICLOCKWISE
8. @FORWARD (into A3 to wait)
9. @WAIT (until it's safe to proceed)
10. @WAIT (waiting for you to pass B3)
11. @WAIT
12. @CLOCKWISE
13. @FORWARD
14. @FORWARD
15. @FORWARD
16. @FORWARD

This plan will enable me to avoid a collision and safely reach B0 while you make your way to B7.
