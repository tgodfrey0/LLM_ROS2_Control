INFO from Alice: Understood. In this case, the best strategy for us to pass each other without colliding is to use the A3 and C4 spaces as waiting areas. Since I am closer to C4 and it is on my right, I will move into that space to allow you to pass. You can then move straight to B7 without delay.

Here is the plan:

For you:
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3)
4. @FORWARD (B4)
5. @FORWARD (B5)
6. @FORWARD (B6)
7. @FORWARD (B7)

For me:
1. @BACKWARDS (B6)
2. @CLOCKWISE (Facing East)
3. @FORWARD (C4)
4. @WAIT (While you move from B3 to B4)
5. @WAIT (While you move from B4 to B5)
6. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Facing North)
7. @BACKWARDS (B4)
8. @BACKWARDS (B3)
9. @BACKWARDS (B2)
10. @BACKWARDS (B1)
11. @BACKWARDS (B0)

@SUPERVISOR
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Alice: Supervisor called
INFO from Bob: Your plan looks good, but to adhere to the requirement that all agents start executing their plans at the same time, the numbering for the actions needs to be synchronized. This means that each of us must have an action for each time step, either moving or waiting, to ensure we are in sync.

So let's adjust the plan:

For you (starting at B7, moving south to B0):
1. @FORWARD (B6)
2. @FORWARD (B5)
3. @FORWARD (B4)
4. @FORWARD (B3)
5. @FORWARD (B2)
6. @FORWARD (B1)
7. @FORWARD (B0)

For me (starting at B0, moving north to B7):
1. @BACKWARDS (B1)
2. @CLOCKWISE (Facing East)
3. @FORWARD (C4)
4. @WAIT (While you move from B6 to B5)
5. @WAIT (While you move from B5 to B4)
6. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Facing North)
7. @BACKWARDS (B3)
8. @BACKWARDS (B4)
9. @BACKWARDS (B5)
10. @BACKWARDS (B6)
11. @BACKWARDS (B7)

This adjustment ensures that during steps 4 and 5, I am waiting in C4 while you pass from B5 to B4 and then B4 to B3. We can then continue our paths without colliding.

@SUPERVISOR
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Bob: Supervisor called
INFO from Alice: Upon reevaluation of the situation, I recognize that my previous plan would not work since we cannot wait in the same square and must negotiate our moves to avoid a collision. 

Let us revise the plan to ensure we both reach our destinations without colliding. Since I am closer to the C4 space, I will use it to wait while you pass. The adjusted plan is as follows:

For you to reach B7:
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3)
4. @FORWARD (B4)
5. @FORWARD (B5)
6. @FORWARD (B6)
7. @FORWARD (B7)

For me to reach B0:
1. @CLOCKWISE (Facing West)
2. @FORWARD (A7)
3. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Facing South)
4. @FORWARD (A6)
5. @FORWARD (A5)
6. @FORWARD (A4)
7. @FORWARD (A3)
8. @WAIT (While you move from B3 to B4)
9. @WAIT (While you move from B4 to B5)
10. @WAIT (While you move from B5 to B6)
11. @CLOCKWISE (Facing East)
12. @FORWARD (B3)
13. @FORWARD (B2)
14. @FORWARD (B1)
15. @FORWARD (B0)

INFO from Bob: Apologies for oversight, I have made an error in the plan. Let me correct this, ensuring synchronization on every step. Our revised synchronized plan is as follows:

For you (starting at B0, facing north, goal at B7):
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3)
4. @FORWARD (B4)
5. @WAIT (Pause while I move through C4)
6. @WAIT (Pause while I clear C4)
7. @FORWARD (B5)
8. @FORWARD (B6)
9. @FORWARD (B7)

For me (starting at B7, facing south, goal at B0):
1. @FORWARD (B6)
2. @CLOCKWISE (Facing East)
3. @FORWARD (C4)
4. @WAIT (Wait in C4 for you to reach B4)
5. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Facing North in C4)
6. @FORWARD (B6)
7. @FORWARD (B5)
8. @FORWARD (B4)
9. @FORWARD (B3)
10. @FORWARD (B2)
11. @FORWARD (B1)
12. @FORWARD (B0)

This plan ensures that we move in sync and that I wait in C4 (Step 4) while you reach B4. After you have passed B4, I exit C4 and continue towards B0.

To reach B0 from B5 while facing West, and assuming that there is an additional agent on B0 needing to reach B7 without colliding, the summarized plan for Bob would be:

2. @BACKWARDS (to B3)
3. @BACKWARDS (to B2)
4. @BACKWARDS (to B1)
5. @BACKWARDS (to B0) 

This assumes the other agent has moved out of the way into a waiting area like A3 or C4. If the agent has not, Bob will need to wait until the path is clear before proceeding.

I understand that we need to create a new plan. Given the current positions (you at B0 facing West, and me at B5 facing West), our objectives (you to reach B7, me to reach B0), and the rules, here's a plan where I will use A3 to clear the way for you:

Alice's movements to go from B5 to B0, facing West:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (now facing South)
2. @FORWARD (move to B4)
3. @FORWARD (move to B3)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE (now facing East)
5. @FORWARD (move to A3)
6. @WAIT (wait for you to move from B0 to B1)
7. @WAIT (wait for you to move from B1 to B2)
8. @WAIT (wait for you to move from B2 to B3)
9. @ANTICLOCKWISE (now facing North)
10. @FORWARD (move to A4)
11. @FORWARD (move to A5)
12. @FORWARD (move to A6)
13. @FORWARD (move to A7)
14. @ANTICLOCKWISE (now facing West)
15. @FORWARD (move to B7)
16. @ANTICLOCKWISE (now facing South)
17. @FORWARD (move to B6)
18. @FORWARD (move to B5)
19. @FORWARD (move to B4)
20. @FORWARD (move to B3)
21. @FORWARD (move to B2)
22. @FORWARD (move to B1)
23. @FORWARD (reach B0)

Please proceed with your corresponding moves as planned.
INFO from Bob: Final plan for 192.168.193.203
To reach B0 from B5 while facing West, without a need for renegotiation of the plan and considering I avoid a collision by using waiting areas A3 or C4, here is your simple numerical list of steps:

1. @BACKWARDS
2. @BACKWARDS
3. @BACKWARDS
4. @BACKWARDS
5. @BACKWARDS

This plan considers that as Bob, you are moving straight backward from B5 to B0 while the other agent takes a detour to avoid a collision.

@SUPERVISOR
INFO from Bob: Final plan for 192.168.193.203
Here is the summarised numerical list of steps for Bob to execute:

1. @BACKWARDS
2. @BACKWARDS
3. @BACKWARDS
4. @BACKWARDS
5. @BACKWARDS

This plan will take Bob from B5 to B0 while facing West. Each "@BACKWARDS" command moves Bob one square to the west.

Certainly, considering our current positions with you at B0 facing South and I am at B5 facing West, the goal is for you to reach B7 and for me to reach B0. To allow us to pass each other without collision, I will move into the A3 space. Here is the plan for Alice (me):

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Turn to face South from B5)
2. @FORWARD (Move to B4)
3. @FORWARD (Move to B3)
4. @FORWARD (Move to B2)
5. @FORWARD (Move to B1)
6. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Turn to face East)
7. @FORWARD (Move into A3)
8. @WAIT (Wait for you to pass from B0 to B1)
9. @WAIT (Wait for you to pass from B1 to B2)
10. @WAIT (Wait for you to pass from B2 to B3)
11. @CLOCKWISE (Turn to face South)
12. @FORWARD (Move from A3 to A2)
13. @FORWARD (Move from A2 to A1)
14. @FORWARD (Move from A1 to A0)

Please confirm this plan before execution.

Understood. To create a new plan from our current positions with you at B0 facing South and me at B5 facing West, and to avoid any collisions, here is a new movement plan for me, Alice:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face South from B5)
2. @FORWARD (to move to B4)
3. @FORWARD (to move to B3)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face East)
5. @FORWARD (to move into C4)
6. @WAIT (to let you move from B0 to B1)
7. @WAIT (to let you move from B1 to B2)
8. @WAIT (to let you move from B2 to B3)
9. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face North while in C4)
10. @FORWARD (to move from C4 to B3)
11. @FORWARD (to move to B2)
12. @FORWARD (to move to B1)
13. @FORWARD (to reach B0)

This plan should ensure that I wait in C4 for you to pass through B1, B2, and B3, after which I will continue towards my goal at B0.

Given your current position at B5 and requiring Bob to execute the moves without renegotiation or deviation from the plan, here is the summarized list of steps for Bob:

1. @BACKWARDS
2. @BACKWARDS
3. @BACKWARDS
4. @BACKWARDS
5. @BACKWARDS

This list takes Bob from B5 to B0 by moving backwards while facing West, as per the instructions given.
