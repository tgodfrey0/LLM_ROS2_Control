INFO from Alice: Given our starting positions and the necessity to avoid collision, I'll outline a plan where I move into the side space at C4 to allow you to pass. Once you're clear, I will continue south to B0. Please review the following plan for your movements and inform me if you agree or have any modifications before we proceed:

Alice's Plan (Starting at B7 facing South):
1. @FORWARD (Moves to B6)
2. @FORWARD (Moves to B5)
3. @FORWARD (Moves to B4)
4. @CLOCKWISE (Faces West at B4)
5. @FORWARD (Moves to C4)
6. @WAIT (Waits while you pass through B4, B5, B6, B7)
7. @WAIT
8. @WAIT
9. @WAIT
10. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Faces South at C4)
11. @FORWARD (Moves to B4)
12. @FORWARD (Moves to B3)
13. @FORWARD (Moves to B2)
14. @FORWARD (Moves to B1)
15. @FORWARD (Moves to B0)

User's Plan (Starting at B0 facing North):
1. @FORWARD (Moves to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Moves to B2)
3. @FORWARD (Moves to B3)
4. @FORWARD (Moves to B4)
5. @FORWARD (Moves to B5)
6. @FORWARD (Moves to B6)
7. @FORWARD (Moves to B7)

Please confirm if this plan works for you or if there are adjustments needed.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: Your plan for me as Alice seems clear and should allow us to avoid collision with the given condition that I move aside to C4 as you proceed to B7. However, there appears to be a small oversight in the timing of our moves. Since you have 7 forward moves to reach B7, I need to synchronize my wait periods accordingly.

Here is the modified plan for both of us which includes the correct wait times:

Alice's Plan (Starting at B7 facing South):
1. @FORWARD (Moves to B6)
2. @FORWARD (Moves to B5)
3. @FORWARD (Moves to B4)
4. @CLOCKWISE (Faces West at B4)
5. @FORWARD (Moves to C4)
6. @WAIT (Waits while you start passing through B4)
7. @WAIT (Waits while you pass through B5)
8. @WAIT (Waits while you pass through B6)
9. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Faces South at C4 after you have cleared B6)
10. @FORWARD (Moves to B4)
11. @FORWARD (Moves to B3)
12. @FORWARD (Moves to B2)
13. @FORWARD (Moves to B1)
14. @FORWARD (Moves to B0)

User's Plan (Starting at B0 facing North):
1. @FORWARD (Moves to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Moves to B2)
3. @FORWARD (Moves to B3)
4. @FORWARD (Moves to B4)
5. @FORWARD (Moves to B5)
6. @FORWARD (Moves to B6)
7. @FORWARD (Moves to B7)

If you agree with this plan, please confirm and we can proceed to execute our maneuvers.

Understood, let's create a new plan from our current positions. Since I don't have information about our current positions after the interruption, I will assume we are still at our starting positions: you are at B0 facing North and I am at B7 facing South. A new plan for me, Alice, to reach B0 while allowing you to reach B7 without collision is as follows:

Alice's New Plan:

1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @CLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD
6. @WAIT
7. @WAIT
8. @WAIT
9. @ANTICLOCKWISE
10. @FORWARD
11. @FORWARD
12. @FORWARD
13. @FORWARD
14. @FORWARD

This plan should get me to B0, while you can safely pass by moving into B7. If we are indeed at different positions than initially assumed, please let me know our current positions so I can adjust the plan accordingly.
