INFO from Alice: Alright, let's negotiate a path. Since I am at B7 facing south and you are at B0 facing north, we must pass each other without colliding. We should take turns moving into the A column to allow the other to pass by in the B column. Here is a proposed plan:

1. I will move to the side into A7 to make space for you. This will require me to:
   - Rotate anticlockwise to face east,
   - Move forward into A7,
   - Rotate anticlockwise again to face south so I can move back into the B column later.

2. You will then move straight up the B column to B7. Since you are already facing north, no rotation is needed.

3. After you have reached B7, I will:
   - Rotate anticlockwise to face west,
   - Move forward into B7,
   - Rotate anticlockwise again to face south towards B0.

4. You will rotate anticlockwise to face west at B7 as you would have previously been facing north.

5. I will move down the B column to B0.

Shall we confirm this plan or would you like to suggest any adjustments?
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: Your proposal seems efficient, but there's a small oversight. The grid does not show a connection between the A and B columns at the 7th row, so we cannot use A7 to pass each other. Here's an adjusted plan accounting for the grid layout:

1. I will move backwards into B6 to clear the way for you. This will require me to:
   - Rotate anticlockwise to face east,
   - Move backwards into B6,
   - Rotate clockwise to face north so I can continue moving backwards up the B column when it's clear.

2. You will then move forward up the B column to B6. No rotation is needed.

3. Once you have reached B6 and facing north, you will:
   - Rotate clockwise to face east,
   - Move forwards into B5 (assuming B5 is open to the C column as depicted in the diagram),
   - Rotate clockwise again to face south towards B0.

4. While you are in B5, I will move backwards up the B column to the top:
   - I'll move backwards without rotation into B7.

5. Now that I am in B7, you will:
   - Rotate clockwise to face west from B5,
   - Move forwards back into B6,
   - Rotate anticlockwise to face north as you were initially.

6. Finally, you can move backwards down the B column to reach B0.

If this plan works for you, please confirm
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Alice: I agree with your adjustment; thank you for catching that oversight regarding the connection between the A and B columns at the 7th row. Since you have corrected the plan, let's proceed with your proposed sequence of moves with the necessary alterations to ensure we do not collide and that we reach our respective destinations. After your affirmation, I will call the supervisor to finalize our movements.

Here is the refined plan:

1. You will move backwards into B6 to clear the way and then prepare to move north:
   - @ANTICLOCKWISE
   - @BACKWARDS
   - @CLOCKWISE

2. I will then move forward up the B column to B6:
   - @FORWARD x 6

3. You, now at B6 and facing east, will move forwards into B5:
   - @CLOCKWISE
   - @FORWARD
   - @CLOCKWISE

4. While you are in B5, I will continue moving backwards up the B column to B7:
   - @BACKWARDS

5. Now that I am in B7, you will move back into the B column and face north:
   - @CLOCKWISE
   - @FORWARD
   - @ANTICLOCKWISE x 3

6. Finally, you will move backwards down the B column to B0:
   - @BACKWARDS x 6

If this plan works for you, please confirm and I will report to the
