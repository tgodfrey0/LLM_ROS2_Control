INFO from Alice: Understood. Given the initial conditions, here is a suggested plan that allows us to swap positions without collision:

1. I will perform a @FORWARD movement to position A0 and you will perform a @BACKWARDS movement to position C7. 
2. We both perform a @CLOCKWISE rotation to face towards each other's starting points. 
3. I will then execute a @FORWARD movement to position A7 while you perform a @BACKWARDS movement to position C0.
4. We both perform a @CLOCKWISE rotation to prepare for the swap direction.
5. I will execute a @FORWARD movement to position B7 while you perform a @BACKWARDS movement to position B0. This brings us to our final desired positions.

Do you agree with this plan, or would you like to suggest any adjustments?
