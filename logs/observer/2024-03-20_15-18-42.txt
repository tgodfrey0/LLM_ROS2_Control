INFO from Alice: Alright, to ensure we do not collide and both reach our destinations efficiently, we should use the passing bays at A3 and C4. Since I am at B7, I will move towards C4 to let you pass, as it is closer to me than A3. Here's the plan:

For you starting from B0:
1. @FORWARD (Move to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Move to B2)
3. @FORWARD (Move to B3)
4. @FORWARD (Move to B4)
5. @WAIT (Wait while I move into C4 to clear the way)
6. @FORWARD (Move to B5)
7. @FORWARD (Move to B6)
8. @FORWARD (Reach B7)

For me starting from B7:
1. @FORWARD (Move to B6)
2. @FORWARD (Move to B5)
3. @FORWARD (Move to B4)
4. @CLOCKWISE (Rotate to face East)
5. @FORWARD (Enter C4 to allow you to pass)
6. @WAIT (Wait while you move from B4 to B6)
7. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Rotate to face South)
8. @BACKWARDS (Exit C4 to B4)
9. @BACKWARDS (Move to B3)
10. @BACKWARDS (Move to B2)
11. @BACKWARDS (Move to B1)
12. @BACKWARDS (Reach B0)

Once we have confirmed our agreement on this plan, we can call the '@SUPERVISOR' to indicate that we are ready to proceed. Do you agree with the plan?
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2

INFO from Bob: Your plan for navigating the corridor seems efficient and safe. I agree with the proposed movements. Once we both execute these steps, we should be able to swap positions without any collisions.

Upon agreement, we'll alert the '@SUPERVISOR' to finalize our intended actions. Let's confirm and get started.
