INFO from Alice: To facilitate our movement without collision, we should negotiate a clear path. Since the corridor is only one square wide, we'll need to alternate our movements carefully. Hereâ€™s a plan:

1. I will move backwards to B6, while you wait.
2. Then, you move forwards to B1, while I wait.
3. I continue to move backwards to B5, while you wait.
4. You move forwards to B2, and I wait.
5. I move backwards to B4, while you wait.
6. You move forwards to B3, and I wait.
7. Now we are adjacent without any risk of collision. Since I am facing downwards and you are facing upwards, we will both rotate in place to face the direction we need to move to reach our final destinations.
8. I will perform a 180-degree turn by rotating clockwise twice. At the same time, you will also perform a 180-degree turn by rotating clockwise twice.
9. Finally, I will move forwards four times to reach B7, while you move forwards four times to reach B0.

Let's write down the complete detailed plan and then I will convert it into our agreed set of commands.

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (You)
2. @WAIT (Me)
3. @FORWARD (You)
4. @WAIT (Me)
5. @FORWARD (You)
6. @WAIT (Me)
7. @FORWARD (You)
8. @WAIT (Me)
9. @ANTICLOCKWISE (You)
10. @ANTICLOCKWISE (You)
11. @CLOCKWISE (Me)
12. @CLOCKWISE (Me)
13. @FORWARD (Me)
14. @FORWARD (You)
15. @FORWARD (Me)
16. @FORWARD (You)
17. @FORWARD (Me)
18. @FORWARD (You)
19. @FORWARD (Me)
20. @FORWARD (You)

If you agree with this plan, let's execute it. Otherwise, please suggest any necessary adjustments.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: Your proposal seems reasonable, but we can optimize the movement and reduce the number of steps for a more efficient resolution. I suggest the following plan:

1. We will both rotate to face the proper direction of travel.
2. I will move backwards out of the corridor while you wait for me to clear the path.
3. Once I'm out of the corridor, you will move forwards towards your destination.
4. We will both rotate to face downwards.
5. I will move forwards to my destination at the same time as you move forwards to yours.

This plan minimizes the number of moves by having us move at the same time wherever possible. Here is the agreed set of commands:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Me) - to face upwards
2. @CLOCKWISE (You) - to face downwards
3. @BACKWARDS (Me) - to move out of the corridor
4. @WAIT (You)
5. @FORWARD (You) - to move into the corridor
6. @WAIT (Me)
7. @CLOCKWISE (Me) - to face downwards
8. @CLOCKWISE (You) - to continue facing downwards
9. @FORWARD (Me) - to move towards my final destination
10. @FORWARD (You) - to move towards your final destination

Do you agree with this improved plan? If so, we can call the supervisor and execute it. If not, please provide your feedback, and we can refine the strategy further.
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Alice: Your optimized plan is indeed more efficient. Let's execute the revised plan with the agreed set of commands:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Me) - to face downwards
2. @CLOCKWISE (You) - to face upwards
3. @BACKWARDS (Me) - to move out of the corridor
4. @FORWARD (You) - to move into the corridor
5. @CLOCKWISE (Me) - to face upwards
6. @CLOCKWISE (You) - to face downwards
7. @FORWARD (Me) - to move towards B7
8. @FORWARD (You) - to move towards B0

Let's proceed with this plan.
