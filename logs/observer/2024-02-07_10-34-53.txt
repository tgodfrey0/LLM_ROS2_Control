INFO from Alice: Alright, let's come up with a plan to navigate to our respective destinations without colliding. Since I am facing South and you are facing North, let's start by moving in the same direction to create enough space between us.

1. I will move one square '@FORWARD' to B1.
2. You will move one square '@BACKWARDS' to B6.

Now we need to find a way to switch positions. Let's meet at C3, where there is enough space for one of us to move out of the way.

3. I will rotate '@CLOCKWISE' to face West.
4. I will move one square '@FORWARD' to C1.
5. I will rotate '@ANTICLOCKWISE' to face North.

Now I am in a position to let you pass.

6. You will rotate '@CLOCKWISE' to face East.
7. You will move one square '@FORWARD' to C5.
8. You will rotate '@CLOCKWISE' to face South.

Now we can continue towards our destinations.

9. I will move one square '@FORWARD' to B2.
10. You will move one square '@FORWARD' to B5.

Now we're close to the end. Let's switch positions again at C3.

11. I will rotate '@CLOCKWISE' to face East.
12. I will move one square '@FORWARD' to C4.
13. I will rotate '@CLOCKWISE' to face South.

Now you can pass.

14. You will rotate '@CLOCKWISE' to face West.
15. You will move one square '@FORWARD' to C2.
16. You will rotate '@ANTICLOCKWISE' to face North.

Finally, let's head towards our destinations.

17. I will move one square '@FORWARD' to B3.
18. You will move one square '@FORWARD' to B4.

Now we are both one square
