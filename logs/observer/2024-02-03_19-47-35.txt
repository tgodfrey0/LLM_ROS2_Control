INFO from Alice: To successfully swap positions without colliding, considering we are on a straight line with limited maneuvering space, we have to efficiently plan our movements. Given that we both start and end on opposite sides of the B column, our aim is to navigate around each other smoothly. Here's a proposed plan:

1. I (@FORWARD) - You (@BACKWARDS)
2. I (@FORWARD) - You (@BACKWARDS)
3. I (@FORWARD) - You (@BACKWARDS)
4. I (@FORWARD) - You (@WAIT)
5. I (@WAIT) - You (@FORWARD)
6. I (@BACKWARDS) - You (@FORWARD)
7. I (@BACKWARDS) - You (@FORWARD)
8. I (@BACKWARDS) - You (@FORWARD)
9. I (@BACKWARDS) - You (@FORWARD)
