INFO from Bob: Reviewing the proposed plan, there are inconsistencies with our restricted movement capabilities and the instructions we must adhere to. Given we can only move forwards, backwards, and rotate but cannot pass through or occupy the same grid square simultaneously, the direct forwards and backwards plan could result in a collision if not properly timed with rotations to ensure we both navigate around each other rather than attempting to move through the same line.

Considering we are aiming to swap positions on a straight path and assuming there's enough space around us to maneuver (since the specific layout hasn't been described, I'm inferring the need for rotations to avoid direct collisions), a revised plan involving rotations could ensure that we avoid each other effectively. 

However, without the exact grid layout, it's challenging to propose an effective rotation-based maneuver plan that assures no collisions, as rotation movements depend heavily on the available space around us. Assuming a simple case with enough room to rotate and move around, a hypothetical plan (not knowing the grid specifics) might include steps where we rotate to face away from the direct line between us, move aside (forwards or backwards), and then rotate again to allow passing each other safely.

Given the initial linear plan doesn't account for rotations or the necessity to navigate around each other in a spatially constrained environment, could you clarify the grid's layout or propose how you envision rotations fitting into our movement strategy? This clarity could allow for a more concrete plan that includes rotations and lateral movements to ensure no collisions occur.
