INFO from Alice: Understood. To achieve this without any collisions and in the fastest way possible, I propose the following plan:

**Your Path from B7 to B0:**
1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @ANTICLOCKWISE
6. @FORWARD (into C4)
7. @WAIT (2 times while I move from B3 to B5)
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD
11. @FORWARD
12. @FORWARD

**My Path from B0 to B7:**
1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD (arrive at B3 when you are in C4)
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD (after you've waited twice and I've moved from B3 to B5)
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD (I arrive at B7)

Let's both confirm that this plan is acceptable and then execute it.

Understood, here is an updated plan based on our current positions at B4, facing each other. I propose the following movements for you:

**Your Path from B4 to B0:**
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face East towards C4)
2. @FORWARD (to move into C4)
3. @CLOCKWISE (to face South)
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD

This will allow you to reach B0 without any collisions while I proceed towards B7 using the direct path along the B column once you are clear.

Since we are both in B4 and I need to head north to B7 while you need to head south to B0, the best solution is for me to step aside into C4, allowing you to pass. Here's the summarized plan for your movements from B4 to B0:

1. @WAIT
2. @WAIT
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD

This plan assumes that my first move is to go into C4 and wait for you to pass. Please execute these steps while I move out of your way.
