INFO from Alice: Alright, since we are facing each other and need to pass through B3 without colliding, one of us should move to A3 or C4 to clear the way. Given that I'm currently at C4 facing West and you're at A3 facing East, the logical plan would be for you to back into A3 while I wait, then proceed north while I wait in C4 until you reach B7. Afterwards, I can move from C4 to A3. Here's the plan:

Your moves:
1. @BACKWARDS - To clear B3 for me to pass through.
2. @FORWARD - To start your journey towards B7.
3. @FORWARD - Continue towards B7.
4. @FORWARD - Continue towards B7.
5. @FORWARD - Continue towards B7.
6. @FORWARD - Continue towards B7.
7. @FORWARD - Reach B7.

My moves while you execute yours:
1. @WAIT - While you move back to A3.
2. @FORWARD - Begin moving towards B3 after you've cleared it.
3. @FORWARD - Continue towards B2.
4. @FORWARD - Reach B1.
5. @FORWARD - Move to B0 and wait for you to reach B7.
6. @WAIT - Wait for you to reach B7.
7. @BACKWARDS - To move from B0 to A3 after you reach B7.

Both of us will start executing our plans simultaneously. Does this plan work for you? If so, we can call the @SUPERVISOR to review and approve the plan.

INFO from Bob: The plan you've suggested does not work because we would collide at B3. My movement needs to ensure that I do not interfere with your path as you back up and proceed north towards B7. I will wait in C4 while you back up into A3 and then move north past B3 to B7. Once you reach B7, I will move from C4, through B3, to B0.

Here is the revised plan:

Your moves:
1. @BACKWARDS - To clear B3 for me to pass through after you move.
2. @FORWARD - To start your journey towards B7.
3. @FORWARD - Continue moving north towards B7.
4. @FORWARD - Proceeding towards B7.
5. @FORWARD - Advancing further towards B7.
6. @FORWARD - Nearing B7.
7. @FORWARD - Arriving at B7.

My moves while you execute yours:
1. @WAIT - To allow you to back up into A3 without colliding.
2. @WAIT - To ensure you have the path to move forward towards B7.
3. @WAIT - Continuing to wait while you move north past B3.
4. @WAIT - Still waiting to avoid any collision.
5. @WAIT - Making sure you have the opportunity to proceed north towards B7.
6. @WAIT - Allowing you to get closer to B7.
7. @FORWARD - Now that you've reached B7, I can move forward to B3.

Now, as you have reached B7 and are out of my path, I can continue moving to reach B0:

My continued moves:
8. @FORWARD - Moving to B2 from B3.
9. @FORWARD - Proceeding to B1 from B2.
10. @FORWARD - Arriving at my destination B0.

Please confirm if this revised plan works for you, and if so, we
