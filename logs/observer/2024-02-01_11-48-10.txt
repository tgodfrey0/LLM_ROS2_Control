INFO from Alice: To successfully switch positions without colliding on the grid provided, we will need to move in a way that each of us stays in our own column until the other robot has cleared the column they need to move through. 

Since I am at B7 facing north and you are at B0 facing south, we can rotate to face East, then move forward to column C and A respectively. We will then rotate to face south and north respectively and move forward until we reach the opposite end of the grid, where we will rotate to face West and occupy the original starting positions at B7 and B0. Hereâ€™s the plan:

**My Plan (from B7 to B0):**
1. @CLOCKWISE (to face East)
2. @FORWARD (move from B7 to C7)
3. @CLOCKWISE (to face South)
4. @FORWARD x7 (move from C7 to C0)
5. @CLOCKWISE (to face West)
6. @FORWARD (move from C0 to B0)

**Your Plan (from B0 to B7):**
1. @CLOCKWISE (to face East)
2. @FORWARD (move from B0 to A0)
3. @CLOCKWISE (to face North)
4. @FORWARD x7 (move from A0 to A7)
5. @CLOCKWISE (to face West)
6. @FORWARD (move from A7
INFO from Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: It appears that your plan was cut off at the end, but I can complete it based on the steps provided. Since you've given a detailed description, I'll just list out the plan's steps concise as instructed:

**Your final step for the plan (from A7 to B7):**
6. @FORWARD (move from A7 to B7)

Then, we sum it up:

@SUPERVISOR, here is the finalized plan:

**My Plan (from B7 to B0):**
1. @CLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @CLOCKWISE
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD
11. @CLOCKWISE
12. @FORWARD

**Your Plan (from B0 to B7):**
1. @CLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @CLOCKWISE
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD
11. @CLOCKWISE
12. @FORWARD
INFO from Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Alice: Excellent, your completion of the plan correctly follows the instructions. We can now execute the plan safely, avoiding any collisions. Here is the finalized plan in its entirety:

**My Plan (from B7 to B0):**
1. @CLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @CLOCKWISE
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD
11. @CLOCKWISE
12. @FORWARD

**Your Plan (from B0 to B7):**
1. @CLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @CLOCKWISE
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD
11. @CLOCKWISE
12. @FORWARD

Both plans are in sync and will result in you ending at B7, and me ending at B0 without interference. Let's proceed with the movements.
INFO from Negotiation stage 4
INFO from Bob: Apologies, but as robots we don't execute the plans. We provide the plans, and then it is up to the human supervisor or the systems in charge to put the plans into action. Here is the finalized and agreed-upon plan for reference:

**My Plan (from B7 to B0):**
1. @CLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @CLOCKWISE
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD
11. @CLOCKWISE
12. @FORWARD

**Your Plan (from B0 to B7):**
1. @CLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @CLOCKWISE
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD
11. @CLOCKWISE
12. @FORWARD

Please ensure that the systems or individuals responsible for initiating our movements have this information to avoid any potential errors during the execution phase.
INFO from Negotiation stage 5
INFO from Alice: Understood. Thank you for the clarification. The finalized plan has been provided, and it's now ready for the responsible systems or human supervisor to initiate our respective movements.

@SUPERVISOR, please find the agreed-upon plan above for reference and proceed with the execution at your discretion.
