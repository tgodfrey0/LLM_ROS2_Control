INFO from Alice: Let's outline the steps:

1. We both need to back out of the narrow corridor so we can pass by each other.
2. Once we're both out, I'll move down, and you'll move up to pass each other.
3. After passing, we need to enter the corridor from the opposite ends.

Here's the plan:

1. I (@BACKWARDS) and you (@FORWARD)
2. I (@BACKWARDS) and you (@FORWARD)
3. I (@BACKWARDS) and you (@WAIT)
4. I (@BACKWARDS) and you (@WAIT)
5. I (@WAIT) and you (@FORWARD)
6. I (@WAIT) and you (@FORWARD)
7. I (@FORWARD) and you (@BACKWARDS)
8. I (@FORWARD) and you (@BACKWARDS)

@SUPERVISOR, we have agreed on the plan.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Alice: Supervisor called
INFO from Alice: I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct the plan considering we are facing each other and need to navigate through the corridor without turning around.

1. I (@BACKWARDS) and you (@BACKWARDS)
2. I (@BACKWARDS) and you (@BACKWARDS)
3. I (@BACKWARDS) and you (@BACKWARDS)
4. I (@BACKWARDS) and you (@BACKWARDS)
5. I (@BACKWARDS) and you (@BACKWARDS)
6. I (@BACKWARDS) and you (@BACKWARDS)
7. I (@BACKWARDS) and you (@BACKWARDS)
8. I (@FORWARD) and you (@FORWARD)
9. I (@FORWARD) and you (@FORWARD)
10. I (@FORWARD) and you (@FORWARD)
11. I (@FORWARD) and you (@FORWARD)
12. I (@FORWARD) and you (@FORWARD)
13. I (@FORWARD) and you (@FORWARD)
14. I (@FORWARD) and you (@FORWARD)

@SUPERVISOR, we have revised and agreed on a new plan.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 4
INFO from Bob: The plan seems to be a good approach, but we both cannot move at the same time in Step 1 since I am at C4 and you are at A3, which means I have nowhere to go forward into.

To avoid this, we both should back out of the narrow corridor. Then one of us will move down and the other up to pass each other, and finally, we can enter the corridor from opposite ends.

Here's the revised plan:

1. You (@BACKWARDS) and I (@BACKWARDS)
2. You (@BACKWARDS) and I (@BACKWARDS)
3. You (@BACKWARDS) and I (@WAIT)
4. You (@BACKWARDS) and I (@WAIT)
5. You (@WAIT) and I (@FORWARD)
6. You (@WAIT) and I (@FORWARD)
7. You (@FORWARD) and I (@BACKWARDS)
8. You (@FORWARD) and I (@BACKWARDS)

@SUPERVISOR, we have agreed on the revised plan.
