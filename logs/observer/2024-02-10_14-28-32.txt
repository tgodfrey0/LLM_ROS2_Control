INFO from Alice: To ensure that we both reach our desired destinations without collision and in the shortest time possible, we can use the areas A3 and C4 to allow for safe passage. Given that we both start at opposite ends of the corridor and we both need to move in opposite directions, here is the plan:

Since I am at B7 and you are at B0, I will move into space C4, which allows me to clear the path for you to pass through. Once you are clear of the B4 junction, I will proceed towards B0. Here’s the detailed plan:

My movements: (Starting from B7, facing South)
1. @FORWARD (B6)
2. @FORWARD (B5)
3. @FORWARD (B4)
4. @CLOCKWISE (Face West)
5. @FORWARD (C4)
6. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face South)
7. @WAIT
8. @WAIT
9. @WAIT
10. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face East)
11. @FORWARD (B4)
12. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face North)
13. @FORWARD (B3)
14. @FORWARD (B2)
15. @FORWARD (B1)
16. @FORWARD (B0)

Your movements: (Starting from B0, facing North)
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3)
4. @FORWARD (B4)
5. @FORWARD (B5)
6. @FORWARD (B6)
7. @FORWARD (B7)

We must coordinate our movements such that you move first while I wait for you to pass the B4 junction before I move into the C4 space. I have included three wait operations in my instructions to ensure that I don't move into C4 until you have passed B4 completely.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: I see a flaw in the sequence you suggested. Since we both start moving at the same time, I will need to wait for you to move past B4 before I can safely proceed to C4. Otherwise, we would collide at B4. Here’s an adjusted plan:

My movements: (Starting from B7, facing South)
1. @FORWARD (B6)
2. @FORWARD (B5)
3. @WAIT
4. @WAIT
5. @WAIT
6. @CLOCKWISE (Face West)
7. @FORWARD (C4)
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face South)
9. @WAIT
10. @WAIT
11. @WAIT
12. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face East)
13. @FORWARD (B4)
14. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face North)
15. @FORWARD (B3)
16. @FORWARD (B2)
17. @FORWARD (B1)
18. @FORWARD (B0)

Your movements: (Starting from B0, facing North)
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3)
4. @FORWARD (B4)
5. @FORWARD (B5)
6. @FORWARD (B6)
7. @FORWARD (B7)

By adding three wait actions at the beginning of my sequence, I will be at B5 when you reach B4, which will allow you to safely pass through to B7 before I proceed into the C4 slot. Once you pass B4, I will move into C4 and continue my journey to B0 without causing any collisions. This plan should allow us to both reach our destinations safely.
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Alice: I acknowledge the issue with the initial plan. Thank you for suggesting an adjusted version. However, there's still a potential timing conflict since we both start moving at the same time. If you reach B4 as I'm about to move into C4, we would be in adjacent squares, risking a collision when I move west into C4.

To resolve this, here's a revised plan that ensures I occupy C4 only after you have moved past B4 and I am safely at B5 waiting:

Your movements: (Starting from B0, facing North)
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3)
4. @FORWARD (B4)
5. @FORWARD (B5)
6. @FORWARD (B6)
7. @FORWARD (B7)

My movements: (Starting from B7, facing South)
1. @FORWARD (B6)
2. @FORWARD (B5)
3. @WAIT
4. @CLOCKWISE (Face West)
5. @FORWARD (C4)
6. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face South)
7. @WAIT
8. @WAIT
9. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face East)
10. @FORWARD (B4)
11. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face North)
12. @FORWARD (B3)
13. @FORWARD (B2)
14. @FORWARD (B1)
15. @FORWARD (B0)

This sequence ensures that I execute a @WAIT action when I'm at B5, giving you time to move into B5, thus avoiding a collision. Once you are clear of the intersection and on your way to B6, I turn clockwise and move into C4. Then, I wait for two turns to ensure you reach B7 without us crossing paths. Afterward, I proceed to B0 with
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 4
INFO from Bob: Understood. Upon further review, it seems I made a mistake in my suggested plan. I will need to execute a @WAIT while at B5 for more turns to ensure I only occupy C4 after you have completely passed the B4 point. 

Here's a revised plan that takes this into account:

Your movements: (Starting from B0, facing North)
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3)
4. @FORWARD (B4)
5. @FORWARD (B5)
6. @FORWARD (B6)
7. @FORWARD (B7)

My movements: (Starting from B7, facing South)
1. @FORWARD (B6)
2. @FORWARD (B5)
3. @WAIT (at B5 to allow you to move from B3 to B5)
4. @WAIT (continue to wait at B5 while you move to B6)
5. @CLOCKWISE (Face West at B5)
6. @FORWARD (C4, enter here after you've moved past B4 to B5)
7. @WAIT (in C4 while you move to B7)
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face South at C4)
9. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face East at C4)
10. @FORWARD (B4)
11. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face North at B4)
12. @FORWARD (B3)
13. @FORWARD (B2)
14. @FORWARD (B1)
15. @FORWARD (B0)

With this plan, I execute two @WAIT commands at B5 to ensure I do not move into C4 until you have completely passed from B4 to B5. Then, I proceed into C4 and wait for you to reach B7 safely before I continue back to B0.
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 5
INFO from Alice: The revised plan is indeed correct, with appropriate @WAIT steps to ensure that there is no risk of collision. Here is the final agreed plan:

Your movements: (Starting from B0, facing North)
1. @FORWARD (Move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B3)
4. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B4)
5. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B5)
6. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B6)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B7)

My movements: (Starting from B7, facing South)
1. @FORWARD (Move from B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B5)
3. @WAIT (Stay at B5 while you move to B4)
4. @WAIT (Stay at B5 while you move to B5)
5. @CLOCKWISE (Face West from B5)
6. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to C4)
7. @WAIT (Stay in C4 while you move to B6)
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face South in C4)
9. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face East in C4)
10. @FORWARD (Move from C4 to B4)
11. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face North at B4)
12. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B3)
13. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
14. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
15. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B0)

This plan should enable us to swap positions from B0 to B7 and B7 to B0 without any collisions. We will both start our movements at the same time

INFO from Bob: I apologize for the confusion, but it seems there's been a slight miscommunication. As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to execute movements or start actions. The "@SUPERVISOR" tag with the final agreed plan would be a signal for an overseeing entity in a hypothetical scenario where these instructions are being carried out by physical agents or a simulation. Therefore, the tag is meant to indicate that the plan negotiation is complete and that the plan is ready for review or execution within the context of the scenario.

Nonetheless, the final agreed plan has been confirmed, and if this were a real or simulated scenario, it would now be ready to be reviewed or executed by the relevant parties or systems.

Understood. Based on the current positions, B0 for you facing North and B6 for me facing South, and the fact that one of us needs to use A3 or C4 to allow the other to pass, the following is a plan for the steps you should complete to reach B7:

1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD

This simple list assumes that I will be the one to move aside into A3 or C4 while you proceed directly to B7 without any need to wait. If we are to avoid a collision, I will be the one to perform wait actions and detour into A3 or C4.

Given your current position at B0 and your goal to reach B7, and considering that I am currently located at B6 and need to reach B0, here is the plan for the steps you should take. I will make use of the C4 space to avoid collision:

Your movements: (Starting from B0, facing North)
1. @FORWARD (Move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B3)
4. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B4)
5. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B5)
6. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B6)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B7)

Please execute these steps in order to reach B7. Meanwhile, I will move out of the way into C4, then wait the appropriate amount of time before proceeding to B0.

Based on your instructions, here's the summarised list for the steps you need to take to go from B0 to B7, facing North, without any renegotiation. I will use C4 to clear the way for you:

1. @FORWARD (B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (B2 to B3)
4. @FORWARD (B3 to B4)

7. @FORWARD (B5 to B6)
8. @FORWARD (B6 to B7)
INFO from Alice: Final plan for 10.0.1.112
Given that you are at B0 and need to reach B7, while I am at B6 and need to reach B0, the plan will involve one of us using A3 or C4 to clear the way for the other to pass. As I am closer to both A3 and C4, I will be the one to move aside. Here is your movement plan:

Your movements: (Starting from B0, facing North)
1. @FORWARD (Move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B3)
4. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B4)
5. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B5)
6. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B6)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B7)

By the time you reach B3, I will have moved into C4, clearing the path for you to reach B7 unimpeded. Please follow this plan and reach your destination safely.
