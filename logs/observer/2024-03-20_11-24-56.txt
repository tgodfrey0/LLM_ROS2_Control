INFO from Alice: In order to resolve this situation without any collisions, we should use the spaces A3 and C4 effectively so one of us can wait while the other passes by. Since I'm at B7 and you are at B0, it seems logical for you to use the nearby A3 to step aside while I pass through B3, B2, and B1. Once I am in B0, you can then proceed to B7.

Here is the plan for both of us:

Your plan (starting from B0 and ending at B7):
1. @FORWARD (move to B1)
2. @FORWARD (move to B2)
3. @ANTICLOCKWISE (face West)
4. @FORWARD (move to A3 and wait)
5. @WAIT (wait for me to pass B1)
6. @WAIT (wait for me to pass B2)
7. @WAIT (wait for me to pass B3)
8. @CLOCKWISE (face North)
9. @FORWARD (move to B3)
10. @FORWARD (move to B4)
11. @FORWARD (move to B5)
12. @FORWARD (move to B6)
13. @FORWARD (move to B7)

My plan (starting from B7 and ending at B0):
1. @FORWARD (move to B6)
2. @FORWARD (move to B5)
3. @FORWARD (move to B4)
4. @FORWARD (move to B3)
5. @FORWARD (move to B2)
6. @FORWARD (move to B1)
7. @FORWARD (move to B0)

@SUPERVISOR, I have provided the plan.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Alice: Supervisor called
INFO from Alice: Apologies for the mistake, please disregard the previous iteration. 

Given the scenario and the need to switch places without collision, the following plan will aid our movement from B7 to B0 for me, and from B0 to B7 for you:

Your plan:
1. @FORWARD (move to B1)
2. @ANTICLOCKWISE (face West)
3. @FORWARD (move to A3)
4. @WAIT (wait for me to reach B1)
5. @WAIT (wait for me to reach B2)
6. @WAIT (wait for me to reach B3)
7. @CLOCKWISE (face East)
8. @FORWARD (move to B3)
9. @FORWARD (move to B4)
10. @FORWARD (move to B5)
11. @FORWARD (move to B6)
12. @FORWARD (move to B7)

My plan:
1. @FORWARD (move to B6)
2. @FORWARD (move to B5)
3. @FORWARD (move to B4)
4. @FORWARD (move to B3)
5. @FORWARD (move to B2)
6. @FORWARD (move to B1)
7. @FORWARD (move to B0)

Both plans will execute simultaneously to ensure we swap positions without any collisions.

@SUPERVISOR, the plan for both agents has been agreed and is ready for review.

INFO from Bob: The plan seems well-considered to avoid collision, and it allows us to pass each other without occupying the same square at the same time. However, your plan actually contains an error. After moving into A3, you should be facing East, not North. Once I have passed B3, you need to rotate twice to face East after leaving A3, and then proceed North to B7. Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

Your plan (starting from B0):
1. @FORWARD (move to B1)
2. @FORWARD (move to B2)
3. @ANTICLOCKWISE (face West)
4. @FORWARD (move to A3 and wait)
5. @WAIT (wait for me to pass B3)
6. @WAIT (wait for me to pass B2)
7. @WAIT (wait for me to pass B1)
8. @CLOCKWISE (face North)
9. @CLOCKWISE (face East)
10. @FORWARD (move to B2)
11. @FORWARD (move to B3)
12. @FORWARD (move to B4)
13. @FORWARD (move to B5)
14. @FORWARD (move to B6)
15. @FORWARD (move to B7)

My plan (starting from B7):
1. @FORWARD (move to B6)
2. @FORWARD (move to B5)
3. @FORWARD (move to B4)
4. @FORWARD (move to B3)
5. @FORWARD (move to B2)
6. @FORWARD (move to B1)
7. @FORWARD (move to B0)

Both plans are now synchronized to ensure we don't collide. @SUPERVISOR, the corrected plan has been provided.

3. @FORWARD (to move to B5)
4. @FORWARD (to move to B6)
5. @FORWARD (to move to B7)

Remember to start executing the plans at the same time so that when you wait at A3 for one move, I will have moved into B3, clearing the path for you to continue to B0. Please confirm this plan, and then we can notify the @SUPERVISOR.

Let's use the spaces A3 and C4 to temporarily step aside as necessary. Here's my plan for stepping aside into C4 while you move forward, and then proceeding to B0 once you've passed:

Bob's plan:
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (now facing North)
