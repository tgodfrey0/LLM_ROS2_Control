INFO from Alice: Given the constraints and our respective starting points, I propose the following movement plan:

My Plan:
1. @FORWARD (I move from B7 to B6) 
2. @FORWARD (I move from B6 to B5) 
3. @FORWARD (I move from B5 to B4)
4. @FORWARD (I move from B4 to C4, clearing the way)

Your Plan:
1. @WAIT (You wait while I move from B7 to B6)
2. @WAIT (You wait while I move from B6 to B5)
3. @WAIT (You wait while I move from B5 to B4)
4. @FORWARD (You move from B0 to B1 while I move from B4 to C4)
5. @FORWARD (You move from B1 to B2)
6. @FORWARD (You move from B2 to B3)
7. @FORWARD (You move from B3 to B4)
8. @FORWARD (You move from B4 to B5)
9. @FORWARD (You move from B5 to B6)
10. @FORWARD (You move from B6 to B7)

After you've reached B7, I can then move out of C4 and proceed to B0.

Continuation of My Plan:
5. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face West)
6. @FORWARD (from C4 to B4)
7. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face South)
8. @FORWARD (from B4 to B3)
9. @FORWARD (from B3 to B2)
10. @FORWARD (from B2 to B1)
11. @FORWARD (from B1 to B0)

With this plan, we'll avoid any collisions and reach our respective destinations.

@SUPERVISOR
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Alice: Supervisor called
INFO from Alice: To clarify, here are the complete movement plans for both agents:

Agent 1 (You, starting at B0, moving to B7):
1. @WAIT
2. @WAIT
3. @WAIT
4. @FORWARD (move to B1)
5. @FORWARD (move to B2)
6. @FORWARD (move to B3)
7. @FORWARD (move to B4)
8. @FORWARD (move to B5)
9. @FORWARD (move to B6)
10. @FORWARD (move to B7)

Agent 2 (Me, starting at B7, moving to B0):
1. @FORWARD (move to B6)
2. @FORWARD (move to B5)
3. @FORWARD (move to B4)
4. @FORWARD (move to C4)
5. @ANTICLOCKWISE (face West)
6. @FORWARD (move to B4)
7. @ANTICLOCKWISE (face South)
8. @FORWARD (move to B3)
9. @FORWARD (move to B2)
10. @FORWARD (move to B1)
11. @FORWARD (move to B0)

We should each begin executing our plans simultaneously. Does this plan work for you?

INFO from Bob: Your movement plan seems sound, and I have no objections. Since you will move into C4 to clear the path, it will allow me to move north without any risk of collision. Once I am at B7, you will move back towards B0 by first turning and entering the corridor again. 

Let's finalize our movement plans as follows:

Your Plan:
1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD

My Plan:
1. @WAIT
2. @WAIT
3. @WAIT
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD

Continuation of Your Plan:
5. @ANTICLOCKWISE
6. @FORWARD
7. @ANTICLOCKWISE
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD
11. @FORWARD

Upon completion of these steps, we will have swapped positions as required.
