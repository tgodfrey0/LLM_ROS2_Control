INFO from Alice: To ensure we don't collide and both reach our destinations efficiently, let's plan our movements considering the layout and our starting positions. You are at B0 facing North, and I am at B7 facing South. We need to utilize A3 or C4 to let the other pass. Iâ€™ll move into C4 to let you pass through the B column. Here's the plan:

Your plan:
1. @FORWARD (Move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B3)
4. @WAIT (Wait while I move into C4)
5. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B4)
6. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B5)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B6)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B7)

My plan:
1. @FORWARD (Move from B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B5)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B4)
4. @CLOCKWISE (Face East at B4)
5. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to C4)
6. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face North at C4)
7. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face West at C4)
8. @FORWARD (Move from C4 to B4)
9. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face South at B4)
10. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B3)
11. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
12. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
13. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B0)

By following this sequence, you can move up the B column while I detour into C4, allowing us to pass
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: Your proposed plan is sound and will ensure we don't collide, with me taking a detour into C4 while you move straight up the B column. However, we can optimize the movement slightly to reduce the number of @WAIT and @ANTICLOCKWISE/@CLOCKWISE commands. Additionally, it seems there might be an unnecessary rotation in your step 7 (@ANTICLOCKWISE), which would result in me facing the wrong direction. Here's an optimized version of the plan:

Your plan:
1. @FORWARD (Move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B3)
4. @WAIT (Wait while I move into C4)
5. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B4)
6. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B5)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B6)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B7)

My plan:
1. @FORWARD (Move from B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B5)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B4)
4. @CLOCKWISE (Face East at B4)
5. @FORWARD (Move into C4)
6. @CLOCKWISE (Face South at C4)
7. @FORWARD (Move from C4 to B4)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B3)
9. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
10. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
11. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B0)

This plan maintains the efficiency of travel and avoids any collisions while optimizing rotations.

INFO from Bob: Apologies, the @SUPERVISOR tag was called prematurely before the complete agreement on the plan. Let's finalize the optimized plan:

Your plan:
1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @WAIT
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD (Arrive at B7)

My plan:
1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @CLOCKWISE 
5. @FORWARD
6. @CLOCKWISE
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD
11. @FORWARD (Arrive at B0)

With this plan, I'm utilizing the C4 space to step aside while you move straight up the B column.

@SUPERVISOR
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 5
INFO from Alice: Apologies for the oversight with the rotations and wait times. Based on your adjusted plan, here is the finalized and optimized plan:

Your plan:
1. @FORWARD (Move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B3)
4. @WAIT (Wait while I move into C4)
5. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B4)
6. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B5)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B6)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B7)

My plan:
1. @FORWARD (Move from B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B5)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B4)
4. @CLOCKWISE (Face East at B4)
5. @FORWARD (Move into C4)
6. @CLOCKWISE (Face South at C4)
7. @FORWARD (Move from C4 to B4)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B3)
9. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
10. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
11. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B0)

This plan efficiently allows us to switch places without any collision, taking the shortest possible paths with minimal waiting and rotations.
