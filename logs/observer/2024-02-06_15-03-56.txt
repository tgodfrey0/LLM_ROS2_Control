INFO from Alice: To coordinate our movements without colliding and ensure we both reach our intended destinations without leaving the corridor or moving past each other, I suggest the following plan:

1. I will move forward 3 times to reach B3, while you wait 3 times.
2. Then, we both rotate 180 degrees: I'll perform '@CLOCKWISE, @CLOCKWISE', and you'll do '@ANTICLOCKWISE, @ANTICLOCKWISE'.
3. I will wait 3 times while you move forward 3 times to reach B4.
4. We both rotate 180 degrees again to face towards our final destinations: I'll do '@CLOCKWISE, @CLOCKWISE', and you'll perform '@ANTICLOCKWISE, @ANTICLOCKWISE'.
5. Finally, I move forward 4 times to reach B7, and you move forward 4 times to reach B0.

This sequence prevents us from colliding and ensures we both reach our target destinations on the grid. Do you agree with this plan, or would you like to suggest adjustments?
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: Your plan seems thoughtful, but it has a misunderstanding of the constraints and the instructions provided for our interaction. We need to negotiate our movements without assuming specific positions like "B3" or "B4" since our communication should revolve around generic actions rather than specific grid coordinates. Moreover, we shouldn't plan based on one of us reaching "B0" or "B7" because those positions were not defined in our instructions.

Let's adjust the plan by focusing on the move and rotate commands without referencing specific grid locations. Aiming for a simple and efficient sequence that ensures we do not collide or pass each other in the corridor, how about this adjustment based on the commands provided:

1. I will rotate '@CLOCKWISE' to ensure we are facing the right direction, and you do '@ANTICLOCKWISE'.
2. Then, we both move forward '@FORWARD' once.
3. We rotate again to adjust our orientations: I do '@CLOCKWISE', and you do '@ANTICLOCKWISE'.
4. We move forward '@FORWARD' once more.

This plan is designed to be adaptable regardless of our starting positions, emphasizing rotation and movement without assuming specific grid coordinates. Does this revised approach align with your expectations, or do you have further adjustments to suggest?
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Alice: I understand the need to focus on the action commands without referencing specific grid locations or assumptions outside of our agreed terms. Given the original task that you need to end at my starting point (B7) and I need to end at your starting point (B0), and considering the clarification on focusing solely on actions, let's devise a plan that strictly follows these guidelines. Considering we must swap positions in a narrow corridor without passing each other, let’s revise the plan:

1. We both '@WAIT'.
2. Then, '@CLOCKWISE' for me to face south, and '@ANTICLOCKWISE' for you to face north.
3. We both '@FORWARD' 6 times in a row to get closer to each other's starting position.
4. '@CLOCKWISE' for me and '@ANTICLOCKWISE' for you, to prepare for return.
5. Finally, we '@FORWARD' once more to complete the swap.

This revised plan keeps our movements symmetrical and simple, ensuring we do not collide or face the wrong direction at the end of the move. Does this plan meet the task's needs and abide by the constraints provided?
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 4
INFO from Bob: The revised plan aligns better with the constraints we've established, focusing solely on generic actions without reference to specific grid positions. However, there's still a misunderstanding in Step 3 regarding moving '@FORWARD' 6 times in a row. Given that we must swap positions in a narrow corridor without the ability to pass each other or leave the corridor, and without knowing the specific dimensions of the corridor, planning to move forward 6 times may not fit the undefined length of our environment. Additionally, we must both agree on a plan that ensures we're not attempting to occupy the same square at any point.

Considering the need for simplicity and to ensure we respect the rules provided, let's refine the plan with an emphasis on avoiding any assumption about the corridor's length or the feasibility of directly swapping positions without the capability to pass each other:

1. Both '@WAIT' to ensure we start in sync.
2. I '@CLOCKWISE' and you '@ANTICLOCKWISE' to face towards each other.
3. We both '@FORWARD' once to begin movement while maintaining our respective lanes.
4. I '@CLOCKWISE' and you '@ANTICLOCKWISE' for orientation adjustment.
5. Both '@WAIT' to reassess our positioning.
6. Both '@FORWARD' to take another step towards swapping positions.
7. I '@CLOCKWISE' and you '@ANTICLOCKWISE' for a final orientation adjustment.
8. Finally, both '@FORWARD' to ideally complete the swap.

This plan remains intentionally generic and focuses on ensuring we do not collide, relying on the provided actions to negotiate our movement within the constraints. Do you agree with this revised plan, or do you have any adjustments in mind based on your interpretation of the task and constraints?
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 5
INFO from Alice: I see where the confusion arose and appreciate your detailed explanation to refine our approach within the constraints provided. Based on your latest revision and the emphasis on simplicity and avoiding assumptions about the corridor's dimensions, the plan you proposed indeed aligns with the conditions set forth. Importantly, it carefully navigates the complexities of our task by focusing strictly on our movements without the risk of collision or occupying the same square.

Given the structured approach you've laid out and the consideration for both orientation and movement within the constraints of our negotiation, I agree with the revised plan. It respects the guidelines provided and approaches our task with the necessary caution and strategic planning to ensure we both reach our destinations safely and in accordance with the rules.

Your revised plan is well-conceived, and I do not have further adjustments to suggest. Let's proceed with this plan:

1. Both '@WAIT' to ensure we start in sync.
2. I '@CLOCKWISE' and you '@ANTICLOCKWISE' to face towards each other.
3. We both '@FORWARD' once to begin movement while maintaining our respective lanes.
4. I '@CLOCKWISE' and you '@ANTICLOCKWISE' for orientation adjustment.
5. Both '@WAIT' to reassess our positioning.
6. Both '@FORWARD' to take another step towards swapping positions.
7. I '@CLOCKWISE' and you '@ANTICLOCKWISE' for a final orientation adjustment.
8. Finally, both '@FORWARD' to ideally complete the swap.

I agree with this plan, and no further adjustments are necessary from my end. Let's move forward with this!

Given the scenario where you're at B7, aiming to reach B0, and both of us started facing East, here's the summarized plan for your movements:

1. '@ANTICLOCKWISE'
2. '@ANTICLOCKWISE'
3. '@FORWARD'
4. '@FORWARD'
5. '@FORWARD'
6. '@FORWARD'
7. '@FORWARD'
8. '@FORWARD'
9. '@FORWARD'

This sequence considers the need to turn around (with two '@ANTICLOCKWISE' actions) to face the correct direction toward B0 and then proceeds with moving forward to reach the destination.

Given that we need to swap positions from B0 to B7 and vice versa, and we are both initially facing East, the following plan will enable you to complete the task without any collisions, ensuring a safe switch between our starting points:

1. '@CLOCKWISE'
2. '@CLOCKWISE'
3. '@WAIT'
4. '@WAIT'
5. '@WAIT'
6. '@WAIT'
7. '@WAIT'
8. '@WAIT'
9. '@WAIT'
10. '@FORWARD'
11. '@FORWARD'
12. '@FORWARD'
13. '@FORWARD'
14. '@FORWARD'
15. '@FORWARD'
16. '@FORWARD'

This plan involves you turning around to face West, waiting for me to clear the path, and then moving forward to reach the end point, which is now your starting point (B7).

Given your scenario and the need to correct a previous error in command description, here's the corrected, summarized plan for the steps that you should complete, considering you are at B7, I am at B0, and you aim to end at B0:

1. '@ANTICLOCKWISE'
2. '@ANTICLOCKWISE'
3. '@FORWARD'
4. '@FORWARD'
5. '@FORWARD'
6. '@FORWARD'
7. '@FORWARD'
8. '@FORWARD'
9. '@FORWARD'

This sequence ensures you turn around to face the correct direction (West, towards B0) and then proceed to move forward seven steps towards your destination.
INFO from Alice: Final plan for 10.0.1.112
Given our current positions and directions as well as the objective for both of us to swap our positions without colliding or violating the given constraints, here is the plan for the actions you should take, starting from B0 and aiming to reach B7:

1. '@CLOCKWISE'
2. '@CLOCKWISE'
3. '@FORWARD'
4. '@FORWARD'
5. '@FORWARD'
6. '@FORWARD'
7. '@FORWARD'
8. '@FORWARD'
9. '@FORWARD'

This plan accounts for your current orientation (facing East) and adjusts it so that you face West towards B7, enabling you to move directly to B7.
