INFO from Alice: To ensure we both reach our destinations without colliding, we'll need to plan our movements carefully. 

Given that you're at B0 and need to reach B7, and I'm at B7 and need to reach B0, we both have straightforward paths to our destinations, but we must avoid occupying the same square at the same time. Since we don't have information on what direction we are currently facing, let's assume that we're both initially facing towards the B column.

Here's how we could do it:

1. You will wait for me to clear the B column before you start moving. I will move first to reach B0.
2. Once I have reached B0, which will take me 7 moves, you can start moving up to B7.

Let's break down the movements:

For me at B7:

1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD

For you at B0 after I reach B0:

1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD

This plan ensures that we will not be in the same square at any point during our movement. 

@SUPERVISOR, here is the final plan in a concise numbered

INFO from Bob: To ensure that we both reach our destinations without collision, given that we don't know which direction you are currently facing, and considering that I start at B7 and you start at B0, with our goal destinations being reversed, here's a plan:

You are at B0, and your goal is to reach B7:

1. You need to ensure that you're facing towards B1. If you're not facing B1, you have to adjust your orientation accordingly.
2. Once you're facing B1, you will move forward to reach B7, one square at a time.
3. While you're adjusting your orientation and moving, I shall wait at B7 until you reach B3.
4. As soon as you are at B3, I will start moving towards B0.

Here is the agreed plan for you (from B0 to B7):

Since we don't know your current orientation, I'll assume you might need to rotate to face the right direction before you start moving forward:

1. You may need to rotate (either @CLOCKWISE or @ANTICLOCKWISE) depending on your current orientation. Let's provision for two possible rotations to face towards B1 if required.
2. Once you are facing B1, proceed with moving forward.

Your movement:

1. @CLOCKWISE / @ANTICLOCKWISE (as needed to face B1)
2. @CLOCKWISE / @ANTICLOCKWISE (as needed to ensure
INFO from Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Alice: you are facing B1)
3. @FORWARD (move from B0 to B1)
4. @FORWARD (move from B1 to B2)
5. @FORWARD (move from B2 to B3)
6. @FORWARD (move from B3 to B4)
7. @FORWARD (move from B4 to B5)
8. @FORWARD (move from B5 to B6)
9. @FORWARD (move from B6 to B7)

Please note that you should perform the rotations only if necessary to face B1. You can skip the rotation steps if you are already facing the correct direction. Once you've started your movement, I will wait until you reach B3 before I start my movement from B7 to B0.

@SUPERVISOR, after the user has reached B3, I will begin my movement:

My movement from B7 to B0:

1. @FORWARD (move from B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (move from B6 to B5)
3. @FORWARD (move from B5 to B4)
4. @FORWARD (move from B4 to B3)
5. @FORWARD (move from B3 to B2)
6. @FORWARD (move from B2 to B1)
7. @FORWARD (move from B1 to B0)
INFO from Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Bob: I acknowledge your updated plan. To clarify, I will initiate my move from B7 to B0 once you've reached B3 to ensure no collision occurs. Here is your complete movement plan with the necessary rotations to face B1 and move to B7:

Your movement from B0 to B7:

1. @CLOCKWISE/@ANTICLOCKWISE (optional, if needed to face B1)
2. @CLOCKWISE/@ANTICLOCKWISE (optional, again only if needed to ensure you're facing B1)
3. @FORWARD (move from B0 to B1)
4. @FORWARD (move from B1 to B2)
5. @FORWARD (move from B2 to B3) - I will begin moving after this step.
6. @FORWARD (move from B3 to B4)
7. @FORWARD (move from B4 to B5)
8. @FORWARD (move from B5 to B6)
9. @FORWARD (move from B6 to B7)

After you complete step 5 and are at B3, I will execute my moves from B7 to B0.

My movement from B7 to B0:

1. @FORWARD (B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (B6 to B5)
3. @FORWARD (B5 to B4)
4. @FORWARD (B4 to B3)
5. @FOR
INFO from Negotiation stage 4
INFO from Alice: WARD (B3 to B2)
6. @FORWARD (B2 to B1)
7. @FORWARD (B1 to B0)

Please begin your movements and I will start mine after you have reached B3.

@SUPERVISOR, the plan has been set to ensure both robots do not collide.

SUPERVISOR CALLED =====================================================================================================
INFO from Alice: 

It seems there has been a misunderstanding previously. To clarify, here is the final and concise list for the steps that must be completed by you, starting at B0 and moving to B7, assuming you must rotate to face towards B1 before moving forward:

1. @CLOCKWISE or @ANTICLOCKWISE (if needed to face B1)
2. @CLOCKWISE or @ANTICLOCKWISE (if needed to ensure you are facing B1)
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD

Please initiate your rotation (if necessary) and movement while I wait at B7. Once you have reached B3, I will start my movement from B7 to B0.

Remember to omit steps 1 and 2 if you are already facing B1.
INFO from Negotiation stage 7
INFO from Alice: Plan completed:
FINISHED message sent
INFO from Bob: Understood. Your movement plan from B0 to B7 is clear. Once you've executed your movements and have reached B3, I will proceed with my movements from B7 to B0 as per the plan:

1. @FORWARD (B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (B6 to B5)
3. @FORWARD (B5 to B4)
4. @FORWARD (B4 to B3)
5. @FORWARD (B3 to B2)
6. @FORWARD (B2 to B1)
7. @FORWARD (B1 to B0)

You should begin your movements, and upon your arrival at B3, I will initiate mine according to the above steps.

@SUPERVISOR, we are ready to move without any collisions following the predetermined plan.
INFO from Negotiation stage 6
INFO from Bob: Final plan for 10.0.1.191: Here is the summarised numerical list of the steps you should complete from B0 to B7:

1. @CLOCKWISE or @ANTICLOCKWISE (if necessary to face towards B1)
2. @FORWARD (from B0 to B1)
3. @FORWARD (from B1 to B2)
4. @FORWARD (from B2 to B3)
5. @FORWARD (from B3 to B4)
6. @FORWARD (from B4 to B5)
7. @FORWARD (from B5 to B6)
8. @FORWARD (from B6 to B7)

Initiate your rotation only if you are not already facing towards B1, and then proceed with the forward movements. After reaching B3, I will then begin my movements from B7 to B0.
INFO from Bob: Please initiate your movement based on the provided steps. Upon your arrival at B3, I will begin my descent from B7 to B0.

Your final plan from B0 to B7 is as follows:

1. @CLOCKWISE or @ANTICLOCKWISE (if you are not facing B1)
2. @CLOCKWISE or @ANTICLOCKWISE (if you are not facing B1 after the first rotation)
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD

Please start moving according to this plan, and I will follow the collision-free protocol to move from B7 to B0.
