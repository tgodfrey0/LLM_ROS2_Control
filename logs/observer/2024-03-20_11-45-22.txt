INFO from Alice: To avoid collision while ensuring both of us achieve our goals in the most efficient manner, one of us needs to use A3 or C4 as a temporary waiting area while the other passes by. I suggest the following plan:

Since I am closer to A3, I will use it to clear the path for you. I will move into A3, wait for you to pass, and then continue south to B0. Meanwhile, you will move straight north to B7.

Here is the plan detailed:

For me (starting at B7 facing South):

1. @FORWARD (move from B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (move from B6 to B5)
3. @FORWARD (move from B5 to B4)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE (turn to face East at B4)
5. @FORWARD (move from B4 to A3)
6. @WAIT (wait in A3 for you to pass)
7. @WAIT (wait in A3 for you to pass)
8. @CLOCKWISE (turn to face South at A3)
9. @FORWARD (move from A3 to B2)
10. @FORWARD (move from B2 to B1)
11. @FORWARD (move from B1 to B0)

For you (starting at B0 facing North):

1. @FORWARD (move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (move from B2 to B3)
4. @FORWARD (move from B3 to A3)
5. @FORWARD (move from A3 to B4)
6. @FORWARD (move from B4 to B5)
7. @FORWARD (move from B5 to B6)
8. @FORWARD (move from B6 to B7)

Once we both agree on this plan, we
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: Your plan seems efficient, but there is a slight error. As an agent, when I move into A3, I would not be able to directly turn south because the grid A3 is an East-West corridor. The same error is present in your plan; after you reach A3, you should turn clockwise to face East before moving to B4.

Here is the revised plan:

For me (starting at B7 facing South):

1. @FORWARD (move from B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (move from B6 to B5)
3. @FORWARD (move from B5 to B4)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE (turn to face East at B4)
5. @FORWARD (move from B4 to A3)
6. @WAIT (wait in A3 for you to pass)
7. @WAIT (wait in A3 for you to pass)
8. @CLOCKWISE (turn to face South from East at A3)
9. @FORWARD (move from A3 to B4)
10. @FORWARD (move from B4 to B3)
11. @FORWARD (move from B3 to B2)
12. @FORWARD (move from B2 to B1)
13. @FORWARD (move from B1 to B0)

For you (starting at B0 facing North):

1. @FORWARD (move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (move from B2 to B3)
4. @FORWARD (move from B3 to B4)
5. @CLOCKWISE (turn to face East at B4)
6. @FORWARD (move from B4 to A3)
7. @CLOCKWISE (turn to face South at A3)
8. @FORWARD (move from A3 to B4)
9.
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Alice: My apologies for the oversight. We need to ensure no collision occurs and that our movements are correctly aligned with the layout of the corridors. Based on your movements, here is a revision for the completion of your actions after reaching A3:

For you (continuing from B4 facing East):

7. @FORWARD (move from A3 to B4)
8. @CLOCKWISE (turn to face South at B4)
9. @FORWARD (move from B4 to B5)
10. @FORWARD (move from B5 to B6)
11. @FORWARD (move from B6 to B7)

Once we have both confirmed that this plan prevents any collisions and is efficient for our respective goals, we can proceed.
