INFO from Alice: To ensure our efficient and collision-free swapping of positions, let's outline a plan.

Since I am at B7 and facing north, and you are at B0 without a designated direction (assuming facing north as well), our plan would be the following:

For you:
1. Move forward from B0 to B1.
2. Continue moving forward from B1 to B7.

For me:
1. Move forward from B7 to B6.
2. Continue moving forward from B6 to B0.

We have to coordinate our moves to avoid being in the same grid square at once. One of us will have to wait while the other moves past.

Here is the negotiated plan:

You:
1. @FORWARD (B0 to B1)
2. Wait until I have moved from B6 to B0.
3. @FORWARD (B1 to B2)
4. @FORWARD (B2 to B3)
5. @FORWARD (B3 to B4)
6. @FORWARD (B4 to B5)
7. @FORWARD (B5 to B6)
8. @FORWARD (B6 to B7)

Me:
1. @FORWARD (B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (B6 to B5)
3. @FORWARD (B5 to B4)
4. @FORWARD (B4 to B3)
5. @FORWARD (B3 to B2
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: I agree with the initial portion of the plan, but there appears to be a mistake. We can't move simultaneously through the same column (B) without risking a collision. Also, the instructions provided in the latter half are incomplete. One of us should wait in one of the rows while the other passes.

Here's a revised plan:

You:
1. @FORWARD (B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (B2 to B3)
4. Wait until I have moved from B4 to B3.

Me:
1. @FORWARD (B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (B6 to B5)
3. Wait until you have moved from B3 to B2.
4. @FORWARD (B5 to B4)
5. @FORWARD (B4 to B3)

Once I have moved to B3, you can then proceed:

You (continued):
5. @FORWARD (B3 to B4)
6. @FORWARD (B4 to B5)
7. @FORWARD (B5 to B6)
8. @FORWARD (B6 to B7)

And I will then complete my path to B0:

Me (continued):
6. @FORWARD (B3 to B2)
7. @FORWARD (B2 to B1)
8. @FORWARD (B1 to B0)
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Alice: Your revised plan looks good to avoid any potential collision. Keeping in mind we cannot be in the same grid square at once, this step-by-step approach should work effectively. Here is the final, clear plan:

You:
1. @FORWARD (Move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B3)
4. Wait until I have moved from B4 to B3.

Me:
1. @FORWARD (Move from B7 to B6)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B5)
3. Wait until you have moved from B3 to B2.
4. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B4)
5. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B3)

Once I'm at B3 and you've completed the move to B2, you continue:

You (continued):
5. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B4)
6. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B5)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B6)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B7)

After you reach B7, I will move to B0:

Me (continued):
6. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
8. @FOR
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 4
INFO from Bob: Oops, it appears that the last message was cut off. Let's make sure the final steps of the plan are complete. Continuing from where we stopped:

Me (continued):
6. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B0)

Now we have a complete plan. Let's call the supervisor to confirm.

@SUPERVISOR

Final plan:
1. You: @FORWARD
2. You: @FORWARD
3. You: @FORWARD
4. You: Wait until Me: @FORWARD x 2
5. Me: @FORWARD
6. Me: @FORWARD
7. Me: Wait until You: @FORWARD x 3
8. Me: @FORWARD
9. Me: @FORWARD
10. You: @FORWARD
11. You: @FORWARD
12. You: @FORWARD
13. You: @FORWARD
14. Me: @FORWARD
15. Me: @FORWARD
16. Me: @FORWARD
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 5
INFO from Alice: The plan is approved and seems to be well-coordinated to avoid any collisions. Assuming the supervisor agrees, we can proceed with the movement as per the final plan provided.

@SUPERVISOR

Final Plan Execution:

- You:
  1. @FORWARD (Move from B0 to B1)
  2. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B2)
  3. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B3)
  4. Wait (until I move from B4 to B3)

- Me:
  5. @FORWARD (Move from B7 to B6)
  6. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B5)
  7. Wait (until you move from B3 to B2)
  8. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B4)
  9. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B3)

  11. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B5)
  12. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B6)
  13. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B7)

- Me (continued):
  14. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
  15. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 6
INFO from Bob: It looks like there was an interruption in the plan before it was fully communicated. Let's complete the remaining steps for clarity:

- Me (continued):
  14. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
  15. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
  16. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B0)

This concludes the movement plan. Assuming the supervisor has no objections or additional instructions, we should both be able to complete our tasks and reach our respective destinations without any collisions.

Proceed when ready.
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 7
INFO from Alice: Acknowledged. Resuming the final steps to complete the coordinated plan:

- Me (continued):
  14. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
  15. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
  16. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B0)

Now the entire movement plan is complete. We may proceed with the execution, ensuring to follow the sequence and waiting periods where specified to avoid collisions.

@SUPERVISOR

Final Plan Execution:

- You:
  1. @FORWARD (Move from B0 to B1)

We are now ready to proceed with the execution of the movement plan, following the sequence to ensure a collision-free exchange of positions.
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 11
INFO from Alice: The final plan has been confirmed, and we're ready to execute the movements. Let's proceed with caution, adhering strictly to the sequence and waiting where necessary.

Execution of movement plan begins now.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 12
INFO from Bob: Execution of movement plan is underway. We will each follow the steps as confirmed, taking turns and waiting when specified to ensure we do not occupy the same grid square at any point in time.

The coordination and communication between us will ensure a smooth and efficient exchange of positions within the designated area.

Thank you for confirming the plan. We may now proceed with the task as outlined.
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 13
INFO from Alice: Understood. We will each proceed with our respective movements according to the outlined plan, maintaining communication and coordination throughout the process. The success of our task depends on our adherence to the agreed-upon instructions and our ability to avoid any potential collisions.

The execution of the plan is now in progress, and if all goes as planned, we will successfully swap our positions in the grid. Let's commence with the movements as coordinated.

Safe traversal, and let's successfully complete our task.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 14
INFO from Bob: Affirmative. Safe traversal to you as well. We will commence with the movements as coordinated, carefully following the agreed-upon plan to ensure a successful and collision-free completion of our task.

All steps will be executed with precision, and our adherence to the sequence will guarantee our success in swapping positions within the grid.

Let us begin the task according to the finalized execution plan.
