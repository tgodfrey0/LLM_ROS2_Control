INFO from Alice: Understood. We need to swap positions within the corridor without colliding. Since we cannot pass each other in the narrow corridor, one of us has to wait in the wider section while the other passes by. Here is the proposed plan:

1. @FORWARD (I will move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (I will move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (I will move from B2 to B3)
4. @WAIT (I will wait at B3)
5. @WAIT (I will wait at B3)
6. @FORWARD (I will move from B3 to B4)
7. @FORWARD (I will move from B4 to B5)
8. @FORWARD (I will move from B5 to B6)
9. @FORWARD (I will move from B6 to B7)

Your moves will be as follows:

1. @WAIT (You will wait at B7)
2. @WAIT (You will wait at B7)
3. @WAIT (You will wait at B7)
4. @FORWARD (You will move from B7 to B6)
5. @FORWARD (You will move from B6 to B5)
6. @WAIT (You will wait at B5)
7. @FORWARD (You will move from B5 to B4)
8. @FORWARD (You will move from B4 to B3)
9. @FORWARD (You will move from B3 to B2)
10. @FORWARD (You will move from B2 to B1)
11. @FORWARD (You will move from B1 to B0)

Please confirm this plan or suggest changes if needed. Once we agree on the final plan, I'll call the '@SUPERVISOR' tag.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Alice: Supervisor called
INFO from Alice: I need to revise my plan. Here's the updated version:

1. @FORWARD (I will move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (I will move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (I will move from B2 to B3, where thereâ€™s space for both of us)
4. @FORWARD (I will move from B3 to B4)
5. @FORWARD (I will move from B4 to B5)
6. @FORWARD (I will move from B5 to B6)
7. @FORWARD (I will move from B6 to B7)

Your moves will be as follows:

1. @WAIT (You will wait at B7)
2. @WAIT (You will wait at B7)
3. @WAIT (You will wait at B7, allowing me time to reach B3 where we have space to not collide)
4. @FORWARD (You will move from B7 to B6)
5. @FORWARD (You will move from B6 to B5)
6. @FORWARD (You will move from B5 to B4)
7. @FORWARD (You will move from B4 to B3)
8. @FORWARD (You will move from B3 to B2)
9. @FORWARD (You will move from B2 to B1)
10. @FORWARD (You will move from B1 to B0)

I believe this should work. If you agree to this plan, I will call '@SUPERVISOR' to confirm.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 4
INFO from Bob: Your plan looks logical, but I see an opportunity to make it more efficient by reducing the number of moves:

1. @WAIT - You will wait at B0
2. @FORWARD - I will move from B7 to B6
3. @FORWARD - I will move from B6 to B5
4. @FORWARD - You will move from B0 to B1
5. @FORWARD - I will move from B5 to B4
6. @WAIT - You will wait at B1
7. @FORWARD - You will move from B1 to B2
8. @FORWARD - You will move from B4 to B3
9. @FORWARD - You will move from B2 to B3
10. @FORWARD - I will move from B3 to B2
11. @FORWARD - You will move from B3 to B4
12. @FORWARD - I will move from B2 to B1
13. @FORWARD - You will move from B4 to B5
14. @FORWARD - I will move from B1 to B0 

This way, we both reach our destinations with fewer steps. Please review and confirm if this is agreeable. If so, I will call the '@SUPERVISOR' tag.
