I am at B6, you are at B0. I must end at B0 and you must end at B7. I am facing East and you are facing West. We both need to go through grid square B4. Let's coordinate our movements to avoid a collision.

I apologize for the oversight. Let's plan again:

You will move into grid square C4 to allow me to pass. Then, I will move into B1 to allow you to pass.

I'm sorry, but it seems that there was a miscommunication in the previous messages. Let's come up with a new plan:

I am at B6, you are at B0. We both need to go to our respective destinations without colliding. I will move to square B5, then you can move to square B1 to allow me to pass. After that, I will move to grid square B0 and you can move to B7.

Let's go with this new plan. You need to wait for my moves before making yours.
