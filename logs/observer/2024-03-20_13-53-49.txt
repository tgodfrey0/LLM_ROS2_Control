INFO from Alice: To achieve our goals without collision, here is the plan:

**My Plan:**
1. @WAIT - Wait for you to move into C4 and clear the path.
2. @FORWARD - Move to B3.
3. @FORWARD - Move to B4.
4. @FORWARD - Move to B5.
5. @FORWARD - Move to B6.
6. @FORWARD - Move to B7.

**Your Plan:**
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Rotate to face South.
2. @FORWARD - Move to B4.
3. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Rotate to face East.
4. @WAIT - Wait for me to pass through B3.
5. @FORWARD - Move to A3.

As we have different start points and end points, this plan will ensure that we won't occupy the same square at the same time. Once you've confirmed that this plan works for you, I will call the supervisor.

@SUPERVISOR
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Alice: Supervisor called
INFO from Bob: Your plan for me doesn't ensure that I will finish at C4. Here's the revised plan that ensures both of us reach our destinations without collision:

Your plan remains unchanged as it is already optimal. You will wait for me to clear C4 and then proceed to your destination B0.

**Your Plan:**
1. @WAIT - Wait for me to move into C4 and clear the path.
2. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to B3.
3. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to B2.
4. @FORWARD - Move from B2 to B1.
5. @FORWARD - Move from B1 to B0.

For my plan, I will first rotate to head south, move forward to enter the corridor, proceed to your starting position, and then continue on to C4.

**My Plan:**
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Rotate to face South from East.
2. @FORWARD - Move from C4 to B4.
3. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to B3.
4. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face East from South.
5. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to C4.

If this plan works for you, we will both start executing our moves at the same time.

@SUPERVISOR
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Bob: Supervisor called
INFO from Alice: Upon reevaluating the proposed plan, I realize there are errors that would result in an impossible move for you since you're initially facing West and cannot move directly South from C4. Let's revise our plan.

**My Revised Plan:**
1. @FORWARD - Move to B3 to clear A3 for you.
2. @FORWARD - Move to B4 after you've moved to A3.
3. @FORWARD - Move to B5.
4. @FORWARD - Move to B6.
5. @FORWARD - Move to B7.

**Your Revised Plan:**
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Rotate to face South.
2. @BACKWARDS - Move back into C4 to clear the path.
3. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Rotate to face East.
4. @FORWARD - Move to B4.
5. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Rotate to face North.
6. @FORWARD - Move to A3 once I've cleared B3.

This revised plan allows us to navigate without interfering with one another. If this new plan is agreeable, we can proceed.

INFO from Bob: Your revised plan accounts for our intended destinations correctly. However, there is still a possibility of collision if we both try to occupy B3 at the same time. I'm at C4, and you are at A3. We need to ensure that when I move out of C4, you can move in, and vice versa, when you move out of A3, I can move into A3 and then continue to C4.

Here is the corrected plan to prevent any collisions:

**My Plan:**
1. @WAIT - Wait for you to move out.
2. @FORWARD - Move from C4 to B4.
3. @WAIT - Allow you to pass B3.
4. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to B3.
5. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to B2.
6. @FORWARD - Move from B2 to B1.
7. @FORWARD - Move from B1 to B0.

**Your Plan:**
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Rotate to face South from East.
2. @FORWARD - Move from A3 to B3.
3. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to B4.
4. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face East from South.
5. @WAIT - Allow me to pass B4.
6. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to C4.

With this plan, we are ensuring that we are not moving into B3 or B4 at the same time, thus avoiding a collision. If you agree with the plan, then we can notify the supervisor to start executing our moves.

Understood, let us create a new plan from our current positions: you are at B4 facing West, and I am at B3 facing East.

Given the narrow corridor, the objective is for me to reach C4 and for you to reach B0 without colliding. Considering the layout and our starting orientations, you, Bob, should do the following:

1. @BACKWARDS - Move from B4 to C4 to clear my path.
2. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face South and prepare to head to B0.
3. @FORWARD - Move from C4 to B4 once I have moved into A3.
4. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to B3.
5. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to B2.
6. @FORWARD - Move from B2 to B1.
7. @FORWARD - Move from B1 to B0, reaching your destination.

You are currently at B4 and facing South while I am at B3 facing East. Since we are adjacent to each other and my destination is C4 while yours is B0, we should employ the following strategy:

1. @BACKWARDS - This will move you from B4 to C4 and out of my way so I can proceed to B0.
2. @CLOCKWISE - This rotation will change your direction from South to West.
3. @CLOCKWISE - Another rotation to get you from West to North.
4. @FORWARD - Since I am no longer in B3, you can move from C4 to B4.
5. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to B3.
6. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to B2.
7. @FORWARD - Move from B2 to B1.
8. @FORWARD - From B1, go forward to reach your final destination, B0.
