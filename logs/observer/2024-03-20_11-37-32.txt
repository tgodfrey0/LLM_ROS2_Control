INFO from Alice: To complete this task efficiently, one of us should use A3 or C4 to allow the other to pass. I suggest I use A3 to clear a path for you. Here is the plan:

**Your plan:**
1. @FORWARD (Move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B2)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B3)
4. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to A3 to wait)
5. @WAIT (Allow me to pass through B3)
6. @FORWARD (Move from A3 to B4)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B5)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B6)
9. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B7)

**My plan:**
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face East at B7)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B7 to C4 to wait)
3. @WAIT (Wait for you to pass A3)
4. @CLOCKWISE (Face North at C4)
5. @FORWARD (Move from C4 to B3)
6. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B0)

Does this plan work for you? If you're in agreement with it, then I will call the @SUPERVISOR.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2

INFO from Alice: The plan seems suitable. Here is the agreed-upon movement sequence in a simplified form:

4. @FORWARD (Move into A3)
5. @WAIT (Wait for me to move past)
6. @FORWARD (Exit A3 to B4)
7. @FORWARD
8. @FORWARD

INFO from Bob: The plan appears to be reasonable, but there are a couple of points to slightly adjust to ensure a clear path and no collision. Since you are starting at B0 and I am starting at B7, I will need to move into the waiting area A3, or C4 before you reach the intersection at B3, therefore, my action must happen before your third move. Here's a revised plan:

**Your plan:**
1. @FORWARD (Move from B0 to B1)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B2)
3. @WAIT (Wait for me to clear B3 and move into A3)
4. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B3)
5. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B4)
6. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to B5)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B6)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B7)

**My plan:**
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face East at B7)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B7 to B6)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B5)
4. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B4)
5. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to A3 to wait)
6. @WAIT (Wait for you to pass through B3)
7. @FORWARD (Move from A3 to B3)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
9. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
10. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B0)

This revision accounts for the necessary waiting period and ensures a smooth transition between both our paths. If this sounds good to you, I will notify the @SUPERVISOR to finalize our plan.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Since I do not have the current positions and the new plan, I'll list a hypothetical plan based on the initial starting positions which can be adjusted to fit the current situation.

Here is a new summarised numerical plan for Bob (considering Bob starts at B7 facing South and the goal is to reach B0):

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face East at B7)
2. @FORWARD (Move into C4 to wait)
3. @WAIT (Wait for another agent to occupy B3)
4. @CLOCKWISE (Face South at C4)
5. @FORWARD (Exit C4 to B3)
6. @FORWARD (Move from B3 to B2)
7. @FORWARD (Move from B2 to B1)
8. @FORWARD (Move from B1 to B0)

Please remember this plan is based on the initial positions and assuming another agent is ready to negotiate and implement this plan to avoid collisions. If current positions or circumstances have changed, the steps would need to be different. Please provide the current positions if we need an updated plan.

The current situation indicates that I (Bob) am at B7 facing East, and I need to get to B0. You are currently at B1 facing West, and you need to get to B7. To ensure we can both reach our destinations without a collision, we should use the safe waiting areas at A3 or C4. Here is the movement plan for Bob to execute:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face North from B7)
2. @FORWARD (to move to B6)
3. @FORWARD (to move to B5)
4. @FORWARD (to move to B4)
5. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face West from B4)
6. @FORWARD (to move into A3 to wait)
7. @WAIT (to wait for you to pass from B1 to B4)
8. @ANTICLOCKWISE (to face South from A3)
9. @FORWARD (to move to B3 after you have passed)
10. @FORWARD (to move to B2)
11. @FORWARD (to move to B1)
12. @FORWARD (to move to B0)

This plan takes into account our current orientations and positions and ensures that we do not occupy the same grid square at the same time, utilizing A3 as a waiting area.
INFO from Alice: Final plan for 192.168.193.58
Alice's steps from B7 facing East to reach B0 are as follows:

3. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B4)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Turn to face North)
