INFO from Alice: Since we need to pass each other without colliding, one of us needs to use the space provided at either A3 or C4 to make room. Here's a proposal for our movements:

You, at B4 facing South, should move into the C4 pocket while I, at B3 and facing North, move towards B7. This way, you will give room for me to pass, and once I am clear, you can then move from C4 to B3.

Here's the detailed plan:

Me (at B3 facing North):
1. @FORWARD - Move to B4.
2. @FORWARD - Move to B5. 
3. @FORWARD - Move to B6.
4. @FORWARD - Move to B7. (I have reached my destination.)

You (at B4 facing South):
1. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face West.
2. @FORWARD - Move to C4.
3. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face North.
4. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face East.
5. @WAIT - Wait for me to pass B4.
6. @FORWARD - Move to B4. (You wait for three more moves until I reach B7.)
7. @WAIT
8. @WAIT
9. @WAIT
10. @BACKWARDS - Move to B3. (You have reached your destination.)

If you agree with this plan, please confirm so we can proceed to execute it simultaneously.

@SUPERVISOR

INFO from Alice: I agree to your plan. Let's implement it.

Your plan: 
1. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face West.
2. @FORWARD - Move to C4.
3. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face North.
4. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face East.
5. @WAIT - Wait for me to pass B4.
6. @FORWARD - Move to B4 after I have passed.
7. @WAIT - Wait for me to reach B7.
8. @WAIT - Continue waiting.
9. @WAIT - Final wait.
10. @BACKWARDS - Move from B4 to B3.

My plan: 
1. @FORWARD - Move to B4 where you previously were.
2. @FORWARD - Move to B5.
3. @FORWARD - Move to B6.
4. @FORWARD - Eventually reach B7.

This plan should allow us to swap positions without any collisions.

INFO from Bob: Your proposed plan seems workable, but it appears to contain slightly more moves than necessary for both of us. Allow me to suggest an optimized plan that gets us both to our destinations using fewer moves.

Here's the revised plan:

You (starting at B4, facing South):
1. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face West.
2. @FORWARD - Move to C4 to clear the path. (Now in C4 facing West.)
3. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face North.
4. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face East.
5. @WAIT - Wait for me to pass B4.
6. @FORWARD - Move to B4 after I have passed. (Now in B4 facing East.)
7. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face South.
8. @FORWARD - Move to B3.
9. @FORWARD - Move to B2.
10. @FORWARD - Move to B1.
11. @FORWARD - Move to B0.

Me (starting at B3, facing North):
1. @FORWARD - Move to B4.
2. @FORWARD - Move to B5.
3. @FORWARD - Move to B6.
4. @FORWARD - Move to B7.

This plan reduces the number of necessary moves for you, allowing you to reach your final destination (B0) in fewer steps. If this adjusted plan works for you, please confirm, and we can call for the @SUPERVISOR to review and finalize our actions.

This plan will allow Bob to move from B5 to B0, while the other agent moves from B4 to B4 (their starting point). Once the other agent has reached B7 by moving north and waited for Bob to back up to B1, they can then proceed to move back south to B4.

Understood, let’s start again, considering our starting positions and where we face. You are at B4 facing North, and I am at B5 facing South. You need to end at B7, and I need to end at B3. Given the current scenario, here is the new plan for me (Alice):

1. @BACKWARDS - Move from B5 to B4.
2. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face East.
3. @FORWARD - Move to C4.
4. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face South.
5. @WAIT - Wait while you move from B4 to B5.
6. @WAIT - Wait while you move from B5 to B6.
7. @WAIT - Wait while you move from B6 to B7.
8. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face West.
9. @FORWARD - Move from C4 to B4.
10. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to B3.

This plan will allow you to pass through to B7 while I wait in C4, and once you have passed, I will move back to B3.

Please confirm if this plan is acceptable so we can proceed.
