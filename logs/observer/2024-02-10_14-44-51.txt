INFO from Alice: Understood. To avoid collision and ensure an efficient swapping of positions in the given corridor, I propose the following plan:

Since I am at B7 and you are at B0, we need to use either A3 or C4 as a passing point. It will be faster for me to move into C4 while you proceed northwards, as C4 is closer to my starting position. Thus, we'll use C4 as a temporary holding area for me to make way for you.

My Plan:
1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD
6. @CLOCKWISE
7. @WAIT
8. @WAIT
9. @WAIT

12. @FORWARD
13. @FORWARD

11. @FORWARD
12. @WAIT
13. @WAIT
14. @WAIT
15. @WAIT
16. @WAIT
17. @FORWARD
18. @FORWARD

With this plan, I move into C4 on my 5th move and wait there while you advance up the corridor. Once you pass B4, which takes you 11 moves, I exit C4 and continue moving southwards to reach B0, while you continue northward to B7 without any further delays.

Please confirm if this plan works for you, or suggest any changes you deem necessary.

This updated sequence reduces your wait time by one move and mine by one move, ensuring that we both reach our target positions as quickly as possible within the constraints of the environment.

Let me know if you agree with this plan or if there are any further adjustments needed.

With this revised plan, you move into A3 on your fourth move, allowing me to pass through B3. Once I have gone past B3, you can continue moving northward to B7, and I will continue moving southward to B0. This way, we won't collide and will reach our destinations efficiently.

Please confirm if you agree with this revised plan.

Understood, here is the new plan from our current positions. Since you are at B0 and must reach B7, and I am at B7 and must reach B0, we will use A3 as a passing point. Since A3 is equidistant from both our starting positions, itâ€™s the most efficient choice.

With this plan, I move into A3 on my 5th move and wait for you to pass B3, which will take you 12 moves. Once you're at B4 and I am no longer blocking your path, I will move out of A3 and proceed to B0 while you continue to B7.

Please proceed with those commands to reach B7.
