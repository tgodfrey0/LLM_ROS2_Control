INFO from Bob: 1. I propose that we both move one square forward at the same time. This way, we can clear a path for each other without colliding.
2. If there are obstacles or other robots in our path, we can adjust our plan accordingly. We can negotiate with the other robots to coordinate our movements and ensure a collision-free path.
3. Once we have cleared a path, we can continue moving forward until we reach our destination.
4. If we encounter any obstacles or need to avoid collisions, we can use the commands '@BACKWARDS' to move one square backwards and '@CLOCKWISE' or '@ANTICLOCKWISE' to rotate 90 degrees in the desired direction.
5. Throughout the negotiation and planning process, we should use the command '@WAIT' to wait for the time taken to move one square in order to synchronize our movements.
6. Finally, when we have agreed upon a plan, we can call the '@SUPERVISOR' tag to indicate the end of the negotiation process and print our concise numbered plan.
