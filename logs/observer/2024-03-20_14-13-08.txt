INFO from Alice: To achieve our goals efficiently, we should come up with a plan that minimizes the steps taken and ensures we both reach our destinations without any collisions. Since I am closer to C4 and you are closer to A3, it would be best for each of us to move to our nearest respective safe zone, which are A3 and C4.

Here's a proposed plan:

I will move first:
1. @BACKWARDS - Move into C4 to clear the path.
2. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face North while waiting.
3. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face East while continuing to wait.
4. @FORWARD - Move back onto B4, facing East.
5. @CLOCKWISE - Rotate to face South.
6. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to B3, completing my move.

You will move after I clear B4:
1. @WAIT - Wait for me to move into the holding area.
2. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to B4 once I have moved into C4.
3. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to B5.
4. @FORWARD - Move from B5 to B6.
5. @FORWARD - Continue forward from B6 to B7, completing your move.

This plan should allow us to swap places without any collisions.

INFO from Alice: As an alternative plan that allows both of us to reach our destinations while avoiding any collisions, let's consider the following sequence of actions:

My moves:
1. @CLOCKWISE - To face East and prepare to enter C4.
2. @FORWARD - To move into C4 and allow you to pass.
3. @CLOCKWISE - To rotate and face South after you pass.
4. @BACKWARDS - To leave C4 and enter B4.
5. @CLOCKWISE - To rotate and face East in B4.
6. @CLOCKWISE - To rotate and face South to end at B3.

Your moves:
1. @WAIT - To wait for me to clear B4 and enter C4.
2. @FORWARD - To move from B3 to B4 after I vacate.
3. @FORWARD - To move from B4 to B5.
4. @FORWARD - To move from B5 to B6.
5. @FORWARD - To move from B6 to B7 and complete your journey.

Let's verify this plan and proceed once we agree.

INFO from Bob: Your proposal is clear and avoids collision, but it requires me to rotate unnecessarily. Also, steps can be minimized by performing some actions simultaneously. I can wait at A3 while you pass through B3 to B4, rather than rotating twice. 

Here is an optimized version of the plan:

My moves:
1. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to A3 to clear the path for you.
2. @WAIT - Wait in A3 for you to pass.
3. @WAIT - Continue waiting in A3 for you to reach B4.
4. @BACKWARDS - Move from A3 back to B3, facing South.
5. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to B2.
6. @FORWARD - Move from B2 to B1.
7. @FORWARD - Move from B1 to B0, completing my move.

Your moves:
1. @WAIT - Wait for me to clear the path.
2. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to B4 after I have moved into A3.
3. @FORWARD - Move from B4 to B5.
4. @FORWARD - Move from B5 to B6.
5. @FORWARD - Continue forward from B6 to B7, completing your move.

We are using our time efficiently by waiting and moving in a coordinated manner, and it reduces unnecessary rotations.
