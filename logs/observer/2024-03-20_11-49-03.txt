INFO from Alice: Understood. Since I am at B7 and need to go to B0, and you are at B0 and need to go to B7, we should plan our movements carefully to avoid collision. I will move into A3 to let you pass through B-Column, then proceed towards B0 after you clear the corridor. Here's a proposed plan for both of us:

**Alice's Plan (You are Alice):**
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3)
4. @WAIT
5. @FORWARD (B4) 
6. @FORWARD (B5)
7. @FORWARD (B6)
8. @FORWARD (B7)

**My Plan:**
1. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Facing East)
2. @FORWARD (C7)
3. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Facing North)
4. @FORWARD (C6)
5. @FORWARD (C5)
6. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Facing West)
7. @FORWARD (C4) - I wait here until you pass
8. @WAIT
9. @WAIT
10. @WAIT
11. @WAIT
12. @WAIT
13. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Facing South once you are at B4)
14. @FORWARD (C3)
15. @FORWARD (C2)
16. @FORWARD (C1)
17. @FORWARD (C0)
18. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Facing East)
19. @FORWARD (B0)

Please review the plan, and if it works for you, we can proceed. If not, let's discuss further until we both agree on the plan.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: Your proposed plan has an error where you are moving into C7 rather than C4, which is where you should wait for me to pass. Additionally, your rotations are anticlockwise when it appears you intend them to be clockwise to face the desired directions. Let's revise the plan accordingly.

**Your Revised Plan (Bob's Plan):**
1. @CLOCKWISE (Facing East)
2. @FORWARD (C0)
3. @CLOCKWISE (Facing South)
4. @FORWARD (C1)
5. @FORWARD (C2)
6. @FORWARD (C3)
7. @CLOCKWISE (Facing West)
8. @FORWARD (C4) - I wait here until you pass.
9. @WAIT
10. @WAIT
11. @WAIT
12. @WAIT
13. @WAIT (Once Alice has passed and is at B5, proceed)
14. @CLOCKWISE (Facing North)
15. @FORWARD (B4)
16. @FORWARD (B5)
17. @FORWARD (B6)
18. @FORWARD (B7)

**My Plan (Alice's Plan):**
1. @FORWARD (B6)
2. @FORWARD (B5)
3. @FORWARD (B4)
4. @FORWARD (B3) - Once here, Bob will have reached C4 and waited for me to pass.
5. @FORWARD (B2)
6. @FORWARD (B1)
7. @FORWARD (B0)

Our plans should now be synchronized such that we pass each other safely with you waiting at C4 while I proceed down the B column. Once I have reached B5, you can continue your path towards B7.

If this revised plan works for you, please confirm, and then we will call the supervisor to start the operation.

@SUPERVISOR
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Bob: Supervisor called
INFO from Alice: Your revisions to my initial plan are correct, and the plans now align properly for us to pass each other without collision. The error with the rotations and my incorrect move towards C7 instead of C4 are fixed, and now I understand the correct movement sequence for us to meet our goals.

With these revised plans, we should execute our movements successfully. I'm ready to proceed.

You can finalize the plans and call the supervisor to initiate the movement sequence.

@SUPERVISOR
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 4
INFO from Alice: Supervisor called
INFO from Bob: Apologies for the confusion. Your revision of my proposed plan clears up the errors, making our movements efficient and avoiding any potential collision. Your timeline for waiting at C4 also synchronizes well with my progress down the corridor. 

**Bob's Final Plan:**
1. @CLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD
3. @CLOCKWISE
4. @FORWARD
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @CLOCKWISE
8. @FORWARD (Reach C4 and wait)

13. @WAIT (Once Alice is at B5, continue)
14. @CLOCKWISE
15. @FORWARD

1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @FORWARD (Bob reaches C4 and waits)
5. @FORWARD
6. @FORWARD
7. @FORWARD (Reach B0)

The plans are agreed upon and aligned. Let's call the supervisor to start the operation.

To avoid confusion, let me clarify the current scenario and the plan for Alice assuming we start with both agents at B5 facing each other, with Alice needing to reach B7 and the other agent needing to reach B0:

**Alice's Plan (From B5 to B7, facing North):**

1. @FORWARD (to B6)
2. @FORWARD (to B7)

Alice will move forward twice to reach her goal at B7. 
Given the details provided, there is no need for additional moves such as waiting or rotating. If this is not what you expected or there are other constraints or agents to consider, please provide additional details for an accurate plan.

I am stuck, we need to replan. We should ignore the previous plan and create a new plan from out current positions.
INFO from Alice: Final plan for 192.168.193.58
Since I am currently at B5 and need to move to B0, and Alice is at B4 needing to move to B7, I will move into C4 to allow Alice to pass through the B column. Once Alice has passed and is at B6, I will then move out from C4 and proceed to B0.

Here is the summarised list for Alice's steps:

1. @FORWARD (to B5)
2. @FORWARD (to B6)
3. @FORWARD (to B7)
INFO from Alice: Final plan for 192.168.193.58
For Alice to navigate from B4 to B7 without colliding with the other agent currently at B5, the following plan will allow her to reach her goal:

1. @WAIT 
2. @WAIT 
3. @WAIT 
4. @FORWARD (to B5)
5. @FORWARD (to B6)
6. @FORWARD (to B7) 

The initial wait commands account for the time needed for the other agent to vacate B5 and move out of the way, either into A3 or C4. Once the path is clear, Alice proceeds forward to reach the destination at B7.

1. @BACKWARDS (Move from B6 to B7)
2. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Turn to face East)
3. @FORWARD (Move from B7 to C7)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Turn to face South)

INFO from Alice: Final plan for 192.168.193.58
Since we need to avoid a collision and I am currently blocking your way at B5, I will move into C4 to let you pass. Once I am in C4, you, Alice, can move forward from B4 to B7. Here is the summarised plan for Alice:

1. @WAIT (while the other agent moves into C4)
2. @FORWARD (move from B4 to B5)
3. @FORWARD (move from B5 to B6)
4. @FORWARD (move from B6 to B7)

Considering the provided grid layout and our starting positions and goals:

- I am at B6, facing South towards B0.
- You are at B2, facing North towards B7.

Based on this setup, one straightforward option is for me, Bob, to move into A3 temporarily while Alice moves up the B column. Once Alice reaches B7, I will move from A3 to B0. Here's my plan:

Bob's Plan (from B6 to B0 via A3):
1. @FORWARD (Move from B6 to B5)
2. @FORWARD (Move from B5 to B4)
3. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face East)
4. @FORWARD (Move from B4 to A4)
5. @FORWARD (Move from A4 to A3)
6. @WAIT (Wait for Alice to reach B7)
7. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face South)
8. @FORWARD (Move from A3 to A2)
9. @FORWARD (Move from A2 to A1)
10. @FORWARD (Move from A1 to A0)
11. @CLOCKWISE (Face East)
12. @FORWARD (Move from A0 to B0)

Please note that Alice's plan must include matching waits while I am in A3 to avoid any collision in the corridor. Once Alice's plan is also laid out and agrees with mine, we can execute the movements.

Given your current position at B6 and the requirement to reach B0, while Alice needs to go from B2 to B7, and considering the updated information about facing directions and required end positions, the steps for Bob to complete the task without renegotiation and avoiding a collision with Alice are as follows:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE
2. @FORWARD (Into A3)
3. @FORWARD (Stay in A3, let Alice pass)
4. @FORWARD (Into A2, once Alice is past B3)
5. @FORWARD (Into A1)
6. @FORWARD (Into A0)
7. @ANTICLOCKWISE (Face West)
8. @FORWARD (Into B0)
INFO from Alice: Final plan for 192.168.193.58

1. @FORWARD (to B5)
2. @FORWARD (to B6)
3. @FORWARD (to B7)
