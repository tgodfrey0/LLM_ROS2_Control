INFO from Alice: Alright, let's devise a plan that ensures we both reach our destinations without collision. I'm at B7 facing South and you're at B0 facing North. One of us can use A3 or C4 as a passing point. Let's use A3 for the passing since it's closer to my starting point. I will move into A3 while you proceed north. Once you're adjacent to A3, I will then move back to B3, allowing you to pass by and head to B7. When you reach B6, I can proceed to B0.

Here's the plan:

Your movements from B0 to B7:

1. @FORWARD (to B1)
2. @FORWARD (to B2)
3. @FORWARD (to B3)
4. @WAIT (while I move from A3 to B3)
5. @FORWARD (to B4)
6. @FORWARD (to B5)
7. @FORWARD (to B6)
8. @FORWARD (to B7)

My movements from B7 to B0:

1. @BACKWARDS (to B6)
2. @BACKWARDS (to B5)
3. @BACKWARDS (to B4)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD (to A3)
6. @WAIT (while you move from B2 to B3)
7. @BACKWARDS (to B3)
8. @CLOCKWISE
9. @BACKWARDS (to B2)
10. @BACKWARDS (to B1)
11. @BACKWARDS (to B0)

Once we are both clear on the plan and agree, we can call for the @SUPERVISOR to confirm. Do you agree with this plan or do you have any alterations to suggest?

INFO from Alice: Your movements from B0 to B7:

1. @FORWARD (to B1)
2. @FORWARD (to B2)
3. @FORWARD (to B3)
4. @WAIT (while I exit to A3)
5. @FORWARD (to B4)
6. @FORWARD (to B5)
7. @FORWARD (to B6)
8. @FORWARD (to B7)

My movements from B7 to B0:

1. @BACKWARDS (to B6)
2. @BACKWARDS (to B5)
3. @BACKWARDS (to B4)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD (into A3)
6. @WAIT (while you pass from B3 to B4)
7. @BACKWARDS (back into B3)
8. @CLOCKWISE (to face South)
9. @BACKWARDS (to B2)
10. @BACKWARDS (to B1)
11. @BACKWARDS (to B0)

Please confirm if this plan works for you, and then we can notify the @SUPERVISOR to proceed.

INFO from Bob: Your proposed plan is clear, and it effectively utilizes the passing point A3. However, there is a slight inefficiency in your suggested movements. Since we start at the same time, there's no need for me to wait at B3 while you move from A3 to B3. I can move into A3 as you approach B3 and exit A3 after you have passed. This reduces the waiting time and optimizes the path. Let me suggest a revised plan:

Your movements from B0 to B7:

1. @FORWARD (to B1)
2. @FORWARD (to B2)
3. @FORWARD (to B3)
4. @FORWARD (to B4)
5. @FORWARD (to B5)
6. @FORWARD (to B6)
7. @FORWARD (to B7)

My movements from B7 to B0:

1. @BACKWARDS (to B6)
2. @BACKWARDS (to B5)
3. @BACKWARDS (to B4)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD (to A3)
6. @WAIT (while you move from B3 to B4)
7. @BACKWARDS (to B3)
8. @CLOCKWISE
9. @BACKWARDS (to B2)
10. @BACKWARDS (to B1)
11. @BACKWARDS (to B0)

This plan has you moving continuously northwards without waiting, and I only wait once, while you move from B3 to B4, minimizing total wait time. If you agree to this plan, we can proceed to notify the @SUPERVISOR.
