INFO from Alice: Given the constraints and the goals, here's a proposal for how we can both reach our destinations without colliding, utilizing A3 as the passing point for simplicity and efficiency. Since I am closer to A3, I will move into A3 to allow you to pass.

### My Plan to Move from B0 to B7:
1. @FORWARD (B1)
2. @FORWARD (B2)
3. @FORWARD (B3)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD (A3) - Wait here to allow you to pass.
6. @WAIT - Let you pass through B3 to B4.
7. @CLOCKWISE
8. @FORWARD (B3)
9. @FORWARD (B4)
10. @FORWARD (B5)
11. @FORWARD (B6)
12. @FORWARD (B7) - Destination.

### Your Plan to Move from B7 to B0:
1. @FORWARD (B6)
2. @FORWARD (B5)
3. @FORWARD (B4) - I'm waiting in A3 at this point.
4. @FORWARD (B3) - After I resume my path.
5. @FORWARD (B2)
6. @FORWARD (B1)
7. @FORWARD (B0) - Destination.

Please review this plan and let me know if you have any adjustments or if it works for you.
INFO from Alice: Negotiation stage 2
INFO from Bob: Your plan for moving from B0 to B7 seems logical and feasible. However, there's a slight adjustment needed for my plan to move from B7 to B0, considering your location in A3 and your suggestion for me to wait until you've moved from A3 back onto the path at B3. 

Considering we start our movements simultaneously, I’ll adjust my plan to ensure I wait appropriately for you to clear A3 and get back onto B3. Here’s the revised plan:

### My Adjusted Plan to Move from B7 to B0:
1. @FORWARD (B6)
2. @FORWARD (B5)
3. @FORWARD (B4)
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD (C4) - Wait here to let you pass from A3 to B3.
6. @WAIT - Wait for you to move forward from B3 to B4.
7. @CLOCKWISE
8. @FORWARD (B4) - After you've moved forward.
9. @FORWARD (B3) - After you have resumed your path.
10. @FORWARD (B2)
11. @FORWARD (B1)
12. @FORWARD (B0) - Destination.

This adjustment allows us to not only avoid collision but also optimize our movement by utilizing C4 and A3 as points where we can sidestep to let the other pass. I believe this accommodates the timings and movements correctly. Let me know if this aligns with your understanding, and if you agree, we can finalize this plan.
INFO from Bob: Negotiation stage 3
INFO from Alice: Your adjusted plan is clear, and it perfectly accounts for the necessary wait times and sidestep movements to avoid collision. Using C4 for your wait while I move through A3 ensures a smooth passage for both of us with minimal delays. Your attention to the turn and wait mechanics is appreciated for it aligns with the goal of reaching our respective destinations efficiently.

### Final Agreed Plan

#### My Plan to Move from B0 to B7:
1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD - Move into A3.
6. @WAIT - Wait for you in A3.
7. @CLOCKWISE
8. @FORWARD - Return to path at B3.
9. @FORWARD

5. @FORWARD
6. @WAIT
7. @CLOCKWISE
8. @FORWARD

I apologize for any confusion, but as of my last instructions, there was no indication of a change in the agreed plan or details that would necessitate replanning. Given the parameters you provided for your route from B7 to B0 and considering any need for clarity or correction, here is what was agreed upon in the last finalized plan for your movement:

### Your Plan to Move from B7 to B0:
1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD
6. @WAIT
7. @CLOCKWISE
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD
11. @FORWARD
12. @FORWARD

These steps are based on the last confirmed agreement to ensure you could safely move from B7 to B0, considering the need to navigate around me while I'm at A3, this is by waiting in C4 after an anticlockwise rotation, then resuming movement to B0 after a clockwise rotation to align back onto the path. 

If the scenario or your starting conditions have changed, please provide the updated information so we can replan accordingly.

Given the updated scenario with no specific movement plan from your side, I'll create a hypothetical efficient plan for you to move from your starting position at C4 to B0, assuming that's the path you intended based on the initial scenario provided. This plan ensures we do not collide, given the use of A3 or C4 for sidestepping.

### Your Plan to Move from C4 to B0:

1. @CLOCKWISE - To face South from West.
2. @FORWARD - Move from C4 to C3.
3. @FORWARD - Move from C3 to C2.
4. @FORWARD - Move from C2 to C1.
5. @FORWARD - Move from C1 to C0.
6. @CLOCKWISE - To face East from South.
7. @FORWARD - Move from C0 to B0.

Please note that this redirection aligns with a route based on starting at C4 facing West and the need to reach B0, which diverges from the initial scenario stating a need to swap positions from B0 and B7. If there are any discrepancies or additional constraints not considered, please advise so the plan can be adjusted accordingly.
INFO from Bob: Final plan for 10.0.1.191
Given the confusion and the need to clarify your instructions for moving from your current position at C4 to your final destination at B0, alongside the requirement to replan due to being "stuck," let's outline a clear and concise plan. This plan will guide you on the steps you need to follow, considering you are currently in C4, facing South, and need to safely navigate to B0 without any collision.

However, without specific details on the current overall situation, including my position and direction, this plan assumes you have clear passage to B0. If there's a need to avoid collisions or take into account my position, please adjust accordingly or provide the current scenario for a more tailored plan.

### Your Plan to Move from C4 to B0:

1. @CLOCKWISE - To face East from South.
2. @FORWARD - Move to B4.
3. @ANTICLOCKWISE - To face North towards B0.
4. @FORWARD - Move to B3.
5. @FORWARD - Move to B2.
6. @FORWARD - Move to B1.
7. @FORWARD - Arrive at B0.

This plan is generated based on the initial information and the need to replan from being "stuck." It assumes no other obstacles or specific requirements other than reaching B0. Please adjust as necessary based on the current scenario or provide more details for a precise plan.
INFO from Bob: Final plan for 10.0.1.191

Since there seems to be a misunderstanding or a need for a clarified plan based on your conditions and objectives, let's address the scenario based on the last situation provided:

If you are currently at B4, facing West, and need to end at B0 while I am at A3 moving towards B7, here's a revised list of steps for you to execute, under the assumption we're avoiding collisions and adhering to the negotiation that one of us uses A3 or C4 as a detour:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - To face South.
2. @FORWARD - Move to C4.
3. @ANTICLOCKWISE - To face East.
4. @WAIT - Wait for me to clear the pathway from A3 back to the B column.
5. @FORWARD - Move to B4.
6. @ANTICLOCKWISE - To face North.
7. @FORWARD - Move to B3.
8. @FORWARD - Move to B2.
9. @FORWARD - Move to B1.
10. @FORWARD - Arrive at B0.

This plan assumes that I make my way out of A3 and onto B3 after you have moved into C4 to let me pass, ensuring no collision takes place, and effectively utilizes both A3 and C4 for one of us to wait while the other passes.

2. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face East, now facing the correct direction towards B0.
3. @FORWARD - Move to B3.
4. @FORWARD - Move to B2.
5. @FORWARD - Move to B1.
6. @FORWARD - Finally, arrive at B0.

This plan ensures that you turn to face the correct direction before making your way back to B0 without any unnecessary movements.
INFO from Bob: Final plan for 10.0.1.191
Based on the updated scenario where you are at C4, facing East, and need to navigate to B0, while I am at A3 facing North with my goal being B7, and considering that one of us needs to use A3 or C4 to allow the other to pass, here is the revised plan for you to execute:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face North from East.
2. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face West, which is the direction towards B0.
3. @FORWARD - Move from C4 to B4.
4. @FORWARD - Continue to B3.
5. @FORWARD - Move to B2.
6. @FORWARD - Move to B1.
7. @FORWARD - Arrive at B0.

This plan ensures that you head straight towards B0 from your current position, using the commands within the constraints provided.
INFO from Bob: Negotiation finished
INFO from Bob: Waiting for an agent to be ready for movement
INFO from Alice: Final plan for 10.0.1.112
Given the scenario, here's a summarized plan for you to move from C4 to B0, assuming my path takes me from A3 to B7. This plan is designed to avoid any collisions between us by utilizing the A3 and C4 squares for sidestep manoeuvres.

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face North from East.
2. @FORWARD - Move from C4 to C3.
3. @FORWARD - Move from C3 to C2.
4. @FORWARD - Move from C2 to C1.
5. @FORWARD - Move from C1 to C0.
6. @CLOCKWISE - Turn to face East from North.
7. @FORWARD - Move from C0 to B0.

This sequence ensures you reach B0 without interfering with my path from A3 to B7. Remember, timing and coordination of the @WAIT command (if needed based on my movements) are critical to avoid collisions and ensure both of us reach our destinations safely.

I apologize for any confusion, but as of my last instructions, there was no indication of a change in the agreed plan or details that would necessitate replanning. Given the parameters you provided for your route from B7 to B0 and considering any need for clarity or correction, here is what was agreed upon in the last finalized plan for your movement:

### Your Plan to Move from B7 to B0:
1. @FORWARD
2. @FORWARD
3. @FORWARD
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE
5. @FORWARD
6. @WAIT
7. @CLOCKWISE
8. @FORWARD
9. @FORWARD
10. @FORWARD
11. @FORWARD
12. @FORWARD

These steps are based on the last confirmed agreement to ensure you could safely move from B7 to B0, considering the need to navigate around me while I'm at A3, this is by waiting in C4 after an anticlockwise rotation, then resuming movement to B0 after a clockwise rotation to align back onto the path. 

If the scenario or your starting conditions have changed, please provide the updated information so we can replan accordingly.
INFO from Bob: Final plan for 10.0.1.191
Given the updated scenario where I am at C4 (facing East) and you are at A3 (facing North), and the goals for me to reach B0 and for you to reach B7, here is the summarised plan for your movement from A3 to B7:

1. @CLOCKWISE - Face East from North.
2. @FORWARD - Move from A3 to B3.
3. @FORWARD - Move to B4.
4. @FORWARD - Move to B5.
5. @FORWARD - Move to B6.
6. @FORWARD - Arrive at B7.

This sequence of commands is designed assuming that my actions will not interfere with your path to B7, based on the requirement for one of us to utilize A3 or C4 to allow the other to pass, and considering my aim to reach B0.
INFO from Alice: Final plan for 10.0.1.112
I understand there's a need for a revised plan due to some confusion or changes in the scenario. However, given the lack of specific details about the new situation or how the scenario has changed, I'll have to provide a generic solution based on the last known positions and directions:

If you're starting from B4, facing West, and need to move to B0:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face South.
2. @FORWARD - Move to C4.
3. @FORWARD - Move to C3.
4. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face East.
5. @FORWARD - Move back onto the main path at B3.
6. @FORWARD - Move to B2.
7. @FORWARD - Move to B1.
8. @FORWARD - Arrive at B0.

Please adjust the directions and movements according to the actual current scenario, ensuring the steps lead you from your updated starting point to B0 without conflicts. If the scenario or requirements have significantly changed, providing the new start and end points, along with any specific constraints, would help in creating an accurate and effective plan.
INFO from Bob: Final plan for 10.0.1.191
Given your updated position at C4, facing East, with the requirement to navigate to B0, while accommodating my need to move from A3 to B7 without collision, here is your concise action plan consisting only of the commands specified:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face North from East.
2. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face West, prepping for move towards B0.
3. @FORWARD - Advance from C4 to B4.
4. @FORWARD - Progress from B4 to B3.
5. @FORWARD - Move from B3 to B2.
6. @FORWARD - Proceed from B2 to B1.
7. @FORWARD - Reach B0 from B1.

This plan ensures your successful navigation from C4 to B0 without breaching any of the specified command constraints.

Given the scenario where I'm at A3 facing West, and you're at C4 facing East, and considering that both of us need to swap positions with you ending at B0 and me at B7, the plan you need to execute will ensure we avoid collisions and both reach our destinations efficiently. However, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the latest task scenario as it contradicts the initial placement and objectives. Assuming a need to correct and provide a coherent plan based on you starting from C4 facing East and needing to end at B0, here's a concise list based on the allowed actions:

1. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face North.
2. @FORWARD - Move from C4 to C3.
3. @FORWARD - Move from C3 to C2.
4. @FORWARD - Move from C2 to C1.
5. @ANTICLOCKWISE - Turn to face West.
6. @FORWARD - Move from C1 to B1.
7. @FORWARD - Move from B1 to B0.

This plan ensures that you, starting from C4 and needing to get to B0, can do so efficiently. This correction is made to address the confusion and provide clarity based on the standard commands available.

Please note that the actual plan might need adjustments if there are other constraints or specific sequences of movements I should be aware of based on the current scenario that was not previously stated clearly.
